Canada’s big banks are starting to see demand for loans return as they prepare to report earnings, but the highly contagious Delta variant has created a new wave of uncertainty about whether the economic rebound can keep its momentum.

The six largest banks will release financial results for the fiscal third quarter this week, and most analysts expect earnings per share to be about 3 per cent to 5 per cent lower than the previous quarter, but more than 40 per cent better than in the same quarter a year ago.

Investors are expected to look past profits for signs that businesses and consumers are starting to borrow again – an important barometer to show that the economy is recovering. Balances in loan portfolios have increased at a sluggish pace so far this year, and early signs of a pick-up in lending could be jeopardized by a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases.

“Not surprisingly the key topic of interest this quarter will be the pace of the economic recovery and the ability of the Delta variant to derail it,” said Meny Grauman, an analyst at Scotia Capital Inc., in a note to clients.

On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal will be first to report financial results for the three months that ended July 31. Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada release results on Wednesday, followed by Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Thursday.

Loan books are expected to grow modestly, with balances rising 1 per cent from the previous quarter and 1.1 per cent year over year, according to Darko Mihelic, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities Inc. Once again, mortgage loans should stand out as the driving force behind much of that increase – total mortgages rose 10.5 per cent on average in June, compared with the same month last year.

The latest monthly regulatory data show a “slight uptick in loan growth,” Mr. Mihelic said in a research note. On average, the month-over-month increase in unsecured personal loan balances, which include credit cards, increased from 0.6 per cent in May to 1 per cent in June. But the pandemic has created a glut of savings that consumers and companies have yet to spend.

“Individuals and businesses are sitting on excess cash … which has resulted in a material overhang for loan growth,” said Paul Holden, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Inc., in a note to clients.

Once again, large banks are expected to recover a combined $1-billion or more from reserves set aside early in the pandemic to cover potential loan losses that mostly haven’t materialized. That should boost profits, but bankers may remain cautious about how much they release, faced with concerns about the Delta variant.

“I think the sentiment around the executive suites of the major banks is, we all hope we’re past the peak of the pandemic, but nobody I’m speaking to believes we’re out of the woods yet,” said Geoff Rush, senior partner in the financial services practice at KPMG Canada, in an interview. “I would expect to see some further release of provisions, just not in the same quantum that we saw in [the fiscal second quarter].”

The pandemic isn’t the only challenge banks face this quarter. Another key source of profits through the pandemic – revenue from trading and advisory work in capital markets – is also expected to ease after a string of strong quarters.

“We expect to see sequential weakness in the segment on lower trading revenue with volatility and volumes having fallen meaningfully during the quarter,” said Mike Rizvanovic, an analyst at Credit Suisse, in a research note. “However, continued strength in deal activity should help mitigate part of that impact through elevated [mergers and acquisitions and] advisory fees.”

There are also some hopeful signs on the horizon. As of mid-July, consumer spending had bounced back as lockdown restrictions eased in Canada and the United States, rising 13 per cent above prepandemic levels two years earlier, according to RBC Economics. Spending on hospitality and entertainment showed the strongest improvements, which should boost card fees charged by banks.

“I think so much about how well banks do is going to turn on consumer sentiment or consumer behaviour,” Mr. Rush of KPMG said.

Banks are also sitting on an estimated $37-billion of excess capital, according to National Bank Financial Inc. analyst Gabriel Dechaine. That gives them a rare opportunity to make significant investments in their businesses or acquisitions to expand their reach.

Analysts expect that restrictions on dividend increases and share buybacks imposed by regulators early in the pandemic could be lifted later this year. Once they are removed, banks could hike dividends by 6 per cent to 8 per cent and buy back up to 2 per cent of shares on average, according to CIBC’s Mr. Holden.

(AP) — The latest developments on Tropical Storm Henri and its impacts on the Northeast:

The vast majority of customers who lost power in hard hit Rhode Island should be restored by mid-week, utility company National Grid said late Sunday.

The company said about 72,600 customers in Rhode Island and 8,500 in Massachusetts were still without power as of 5 p.m. More than 31,400 customers in Rhode Island and 20,700 Massachusetts have already had power restored since the storm’s impact began Sunday morning.

National Grid said the power outages are most prevalent in coastal Rhode Island, including South Kingstown, Narragansett, Westerly, Jamestown, Charlestown and North Kingstown.

Meanwhile, mandatory evacuations in some Connecticut shoreline communities were being lifted, hours after the worst of Tropical Henri passed through the state.

The National Weather Service recorded what could be the wettest hour ever in Central Park, with 1.94 inches (4.93 centimeters) of torrential rainfall pelting the park between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday.

In fact, the weekend was the wettest two-day period since Tropical Storm Irene swept through a decade ago, said Dominic Ramunni, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton, New York.

“I call it the wettest hour in New York City, New York, for the record books,” Ramunni said. “We’re going to see additional rainfall through tonight as well so who knows what records may be broken here over the next 24 to 36 hours.”

Saturday’s downpour canceled a star-studded Homecoming concert in Central Park, when 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) of rain fell. The rainfall broke a record for the date that had endured since 1888.

Sunday was also another record breaker, with at least 2.24 inches (5.69 centimeters) having already fallen in the heart of New York city. The previous record for the day was 1.85 inches (4.7 centimeters), set in 1994.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee says the state is already moving into the recovery and assessment phase after Tropical Storm Henri, with the top priority being restore power to tens of thousands of residents and businesses.

The Democratic governor says National Grid already has crews out working on restoring electricity, and the goal is to get everyone back online by Tuesday.

“We are expecting temperatures in the 90s beginning Tuesday ... and that is why getting power restored is critical for the health and safety of our residents, our economy, and our small businesses,” he said at state emergency management headquarters in Cranston.

Terence Sobolewski, the president of National Grid Rhode Island, said it is expected to take a couple of days to get power fully restored.

The state has also started the process of assessing damage to get maximum reimbursement from the federal government, McKee said. He said on his tour of the state during the height of the storm, he did not see any major damage.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced he will be lifting a travel ban at 5 p.m. that went into effect on Sunday morning on all empty tractor trailers, tandem tractor trailers, and motorcycles on Interstate 95.

The Democrat urged people to stay off the road until the storm completely passes the state.

Storm-related flooding was blamed for major delays in the Hartford suburb of Wethersfield along Interstate 91, a major artery through Connecticut’s capital city.

Brian Foley, special assistant to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, said there was “water over the roadway on multiple lanes” and a couple accidents.

The northbound lane was closed for a short period and traffic was rerouted.

Eversource, Connecticut's largest electricity supplier, reported 32,902 of its 1.28 million customers in the state were without power as of mid-afternoon.

Communities in rural portions of eastern Connecticut had the largest proportion of power outages in the state by mid-afternoon on Sunday.

The small town of Canterbury had the largest percentage of customers without electricity, nearly 95%, according to Eversource. About 2,180 of the 2,305 were without power. Downed trees were to blame for many of the outages. In nearby Lisbon, 1,205 of the company’s 1,891 customers were without electricity.

“We’ve had trees come down on swimming pools and on several houses. But fortunately, none of those incidents resulted in anybody being hurt,” First Selectman Thomas Sparkman told NBC Connecticut.

Storm-related flooding from Henri has caused major delays in the Hartford suburb of Wethersfield along Interstate 91 northbound, a major artery through Connecticut’s capital city.

Brian Foley, special assistant to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, tweeted that traffic was reduced to one lane and there were multiple accidents.

Traffic cameras showed numerous vehicles backed up. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Twitter urged motorists to “avoid the area while crews work to address the situation.”

Tropical Storm Henri was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, and made landfall near Westerly, R.I., Sunday afternoon with sustained winds of about 60 mph and gusts of up to 70 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Henri has since weakened to sustained winds of 50 mph as it moves inland.

There were few early reports of major damage due to wind or surf, but officials warned of the danger of spot flooding in inland areas over the next few days.

Towns throughout New Jersey reported heavy rains and street flooding beginning Saturday night. Some places got as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) by midday Sunday.

Television video footage showed some spots where flash flooding or overflowing brooks had left numerous cars stranded, some with water up to their windows.

Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy told News 12NJ that the storm in the state had so far been a rain event but “a big rain event.” He said the state had been spared very windy conditions although the winds may pick up later. “It’s a good day to stay home,” he said, urging people to stay off the roads.

Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society, said Henri was reminiscent in some ways of Hurricane Harvey, a slow-moving storm that decimated the Houston area in 2017, exacerbated when bands of rain set up east of the city, a phenomenon meteorologists call “training.”

Rhode Island has reopened major bridges in the state to traffic but restrictions remain in place for some vehicles.

All roads to the beach community of Misquamicut remain closed because of wind-driven flooding. Misquamicut is a small cluster of beach hotels and vacation cottages and was heavily damaged by storm surge during Superstorm Sandy.

The National Weather Service's Boston office has reported about 75,000 customers without power in Rhode Island, about 20,000 customers out in Connecticut and nearly 6,900 customers out in Massachusetts.

The National Hurricane Center says Henri came ashore in the coastal town of Westerly around 12:30 p.m. It had earlier passed over Block Island, a small but popular tourist island 13 miles (21 kilometers) offshore in Block Island Sound.

Henri was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour), and it was producing 19-foot (5.8-meter) waves in some places just before making landfall.

Rhode Island has shut down major bridges in the state due to high winds.

All roads to the beach community of Misquamicut have been closed by authorities because of wind-driven flooding. Misquamicut is a small cluster of beach hotels and vacation cottages and was heavily damaged by storm surge during Superstorm Sandy.

The state is stitched together by bridges so shutting them down may mean people are trapped where they are until the storm passes.

National Grid is reporting 74,000 customers without power in Rhode Island and EverSource is reporting nearly 20,000 customers out in Connecticut.

Henri weakened slightly to a tropical storm early Sunday as it edged closer to landfall.

Millions of people on New York’s Long Island and in southern New England braced for flooding, toppled trees and extended power outages.

Henri was on course to crash into a long stretch of northeastern coastline by midday Sunday. The center of the storm was projected to pass over the eastern tip of Long Island.

__ Heavy rain shut down a star-studded concert in Central Park on Saturday evening that was meant to celebrate New York's reemergence from the coronavirus pandemic.

__ A look at some of the biggest questions about Henri and its impact.The Dallas Mavericks' execution in free agency drew some criticism around the league. An NBA executive was 'confused' by the team's approach.

DALLAS - It's no secret the Dallas Mavericks held high aspirations of adding a co-star to pair with Luka Doncic. Those efforts unravelled before the official start of free agency had even begun.

There was some thought that Kawhi Leonard could consider the Mavericks or Miami Heat had he departed from the LA Clippers, but that ended quickly. The focus then shifted to Kyle Lowry, who was strongly linked to the Miami Heat before free agency even started.

In part of ESPN's annual NBA offseason survey, an Eastern Conference executive was 'surprised' the Mavericks 'stood still' in terms of making a move to add talent around Luka Doncic.

"Can they get a healthy [Kristaps] Porzingis?" an East executive asked about the Mavs. "That's the key. But I was surprised they stood still. They didn't do enough to move themselves forward ... they now have a clock ticking with them on Luka [after he signed a supermax extension this offseason]."

It's one thing to say that Dallas needs more talent, but to be 'surprised' by the outcome is strange when considering the circumstances. The Mavericks made attempts in a weak class but Lowry ultimately opted to sign with the Heat.

Pursuing the trade route would have proven to be a challenge for the Mavericks, too. Kristaps Porzingis' trade value is at proverbial rock bottom after continuing to struggle with injuries and an underwhelming playoff performance.

The Porzingis trade with the New York Knicks further complicates the options at the Mavericks' disposal in the trade department. Not having a selection in the NBA Draft for 2021 and 2023 was a significant limitation when coupled with a lack of dynamic prospects to package.

There is more than valid criticism the Mavericks could receive for their execution in general roster construction over the last few years. Keeping cap space open for a class of free agents that unravelled after contract extensions got done was simply a flop.

It certainly doesn't help when the owner is making comments about 'knowing' that players want to come to Dallas, either. Or when comments are made about the need for a secondary ball-handler early in the offseason all for no addition of the kind to be made.

There's still work to do for the Mavericks front office. It doesn't need to be a blockbuster trade, but bringing in a talent like Goran Dragic could prove to make a needed difference.The LIVE!

“The prime pumping by central banks has a lot of money in the system and unrealistically low interest rates are causing market distortions. I think at some point, the cycle will turn,” he said.

Many of Sydney’s high street traders are struggling due to pandemic restrictions but the pain is greatest where lockdowns are hardest in the city’s west and south-west.

Analysis of purchasing patterns by Accenture and credit bureau illion shows spending at small retailers in the outer south-west of Sydney has plunged by 70 per cent compared with before the lockdown.

Spending in the Blacktown district has fallen by more than 50 per cent in that period and in the inner south-west, which takes in the Canterbury-Bankstown council hotspot, purchases made at small retailers are 36 per cent lower than before lockdown.Click the image to the left and log in to get your exclusive reader perks.Aug. 22—Pennsylvania Leadership Cyber School founder and CEO Dr. James Hanak said public school districts have long complained about funding. Hanak said they shouldn't be because the money is the taxpayers', not the districts'.

Hanak said superintendents complaining about costs is not a new concept.

"In their minds, charter schools take away students and money. They don't like the fact a parent would choose a charter school over the district," he said. "It's sort of an embarrassment, and admission for at least that one student that the home school district is not working for that student for whatever the reason. The money follows the student. So why are parents rushing to charter schools? Because we are doing a better job."

Hanak said the money is spent how the taxpayer wants.

"It doesn't cost the family any money because the school districts have already taken their money," he said. "The real question is who does the money belong to? The school or the taxpayer? It makes sense they should be able to use the money where they want."

"The reason is that we are getting students a year and a half behind on their studies and we only have 6 months to catch up," he said. "Cyber charter schools are held to exact same standards as public schools."

Hanak also said the increase of cyber school students statewide from 36,000 to 62,000 in the last five years was due to the fact that many districts closed their doors during the pandemic and quickly shifted to remote learning during the end of the 2019-20 school year.

"Many parents decided they did not want their children to participate in school districts' programs but a school that specializes in certain programs," he said. "It was a mad rush and I don't blame the school districts, they only had two weeks to prepare and we have been doing it for 20 years."

Superintendents Jason Bendle, of Shikellamy, Dave Campbell, of Line Mountain, and Cathy Keegan, of Milton, said they would like to sit and talk with Hanak anytime.

"At Line Mountain we are not embarrassed, we are, more often than not concerned students making this choice will slip through the cracks. Enrollment last year was up exponentially because some parents didn't want COVID-19 exposure risks and many more because masks were required," Campbell said.

"As a leader during these very difficult times economically, I would be more embarrassed taking advantage of taxpayers as a result of variables public schools had no control over. Especially when taking into account in a public school when a budget is passed no matter how many new students enroll throughout the year our budget stays the same."

Keegan said her district agrees with Campbell.

"We are not embarrassed by students leaving our school district for successful learning opportunities," she said. "The concern lies with the unfair funding formula and lack of accountability for cyber charter schools. It's a hard pill to swallow when you pay high tuition rates to failing educational organizations, especially ones who advertise that their education is free. The truth of the matter, taxpayers are paying for students to attend schools that are not in their school district."

"We are not embarrassed," he said. We want every student to receive a high-quality education. Maybe some cyber schools could provide this, but many times students return from cyber placements well behind where they left us. To Shikellamy their child is more to us than a number."

Hanak said there are 180 charter schools currently with about 62,000 current students statewide.

"Seeing where we will be in the next five years is a hard question to answer," he said. "But I see continued interest in cyber charter schools and now, everyone has experienced a cyber environment and word is getting around we know what we are doing. and more and more parents are seeing this."

Hanak said students move to an online cyber charter school because of a disagreement with some part of their brick-and-mortar learning.

Fazli has already served one term as ACB chairman, from his appointment in September 2018 - following the resignation of Atif Mashal - until July 2019, when he was replaced by Farhan Yusufzai following Afghanistan's bottom-placed finish at the 2019 World Cup in England. His appointment came a week after the Taliban seized control over Kabul and the collapse of the government with President Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country.

"Former ACB Chairman @AzizullahFazli has been re-appointed as ACB's acting Chairman. He will oversee ACB's leadership and course of action for the upcoming competitions," ACB tweeted.

One of the immediate challenges ahead of him will be to ensure the Afghanistan cricket team reaches safely to Sri Lanka for their scheduled three-match ODI series against Pakistan, which is due to begin on September 3.

All three matches in the series will be played in Hambantota and will involve a three-day quarantine period on arrival for both sides.

With an eye on the current turmoil in Afghanistan, questions have also been raised on whether the team will be ready to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup. But the Afghanistan Cricket Board had made it clear that the team will be ready for action when the showpiece event gets underway in Dubai.

Afghanistan cricket team's media manager Hikmat Hassan had told ANI that there is no doubt with regards to participating in the T20 World Cup and the board is keen to go ahead with a tri-series involving Australia and West Indies to help in preparations for the showpiece event.Sign up to myFT Daily Digest to be the first to know about UK business & economy news.

Ministers have rejected industry calls to allow EU migrants to fill the large hole in the UK labour market for lorry drivers, but accept that more training courses are needed to boost the number of hauliers.

The government on Sunday rebuffed a plea by logistics and retail trade bodies for it to grant temporary work visas to heavy goods vehicle drivers from the EU, although ministers are willing to look at increasing training of Britons wanting to be hauliers.

It came as the meat industry said it was preparing to respond to labour shortages in its sector by making greater use of prisoners.

Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary, has welcomed incentives being offered by companies to newly recruited lorry drivers, including signing-on bonuses and higher pay. “That’s a positive thing,” said one ally of Kwarteng.

The business secretary is monitoring bottlenecks in the UK labour market, and another senior government member acknowledged that more needed to be done to speed up the training of British hauliers.

“We need more training courses,” said the government member, citing industry concerns that there should be more flexibility in the operation of the apprenticeship levy and reform of the national skills fund to support the recruitment of HGV drivers.

In a letter to Kwarteng, trade bodies Logistics UK and the British Retail Consortium estimated there was a currently a shortfall of about 90,000 HGV drivers that was placing “increasingly unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains”.

“The impact of the driver shortage is already being felt, with many businesses struggling to get goods into distribution centres and depots and — in some cases — into shops, with ramifications for consumer choice,” the bodies said in the letter.

They added the situation was likely to get worse as demand for goods increased because of the start of the new school year, employees returning to workplaces and the build-up to Christmas.

Logistics UK and the BRC said EU migrants could supplement British HGV drivers in the short term.

An estimated 25,000 EU drivers returned home during the coronavirus pandemic and following the end of the Brexit transition period, according to the trade bodies.

They also said government skills and training schemes — including the company-funded apprenticeship levy — had to support HGV driver recruitment.

And the trade bodies said additional staff were needed at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency to deal with a backlog of testing people wanting to be HGV drivers.

The letter to Kwarteng said the logistics and retail industries could not afford the inflationary pressures they were experiencing.

One medium-sized logistics company had so far invested £1.5m “just to retain their existing drivers”, while a retailer was reporting an extra £2.3m in costs since April due to driver shortages “as they have already had to increase pay twice to retain drivers”, added the letter.

But the government rejected the case for providing temporary visas for EU truck drivers, saying: “The British people repeatedly voted to end free movement and take back control of our immigration system and employers should invest in our domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.

“We recently announced a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests able to be conducted.”

The government has also temporarily relaxed rules on HGV drivers’ working hours so that they can make slightly longer journeys. Logistics UK and the BRC said 450 businesses planned to take advantage of the arrangement.

Meanwhile, the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, which represents butchers, abattoirs and meat processors, will this week urge HM Prison Service to prioritise food suppliers under a scheme that allows prisoners to work on temporary day release.

Tony Goodger at the association said members all over the country were experiencing labour shortages, noting the meat and poultry processing industry as a whole had 14,000 vacancies.CHARLESTOWN, R.I. (AP) — The latest developments on Tropical Storm Henri and its impacts on the Northeast:

The vast majority of customers who lost power in hard hit Rhode Island should be restored by mid-week, utility company National Grid said late Sunday.

The company said about 72,600 customers in Rhode Island and 8,500 in Massachusetts were still without power as of 5 p.m. More than 31,400 customers in Rhode Island and 20,700 Massachusetts have already had power restored since the storm’s impact began Sunday morning.

National Grid said the power outages are most prevalent in coastal Rhode Island, including South Kingstown, Narragansett, Westerly, Jamestown, Charlestown and North Kingstown.

Meanwhile, mandatory evacuations in some Connecticut shoreline communities were being lifted, hours after the worst of Tropical Henri passed through the state.

The National Weather Service recorded what could be the wettest hour ever in Central Park, with 1.94 inches (4.93 centimeters) of torrential rainfall pelting the park between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Saturday.

In fact, the weekend was the wettest two-day period since Tropical Storm Irene swept through a decade ago, said Dominic Ramunni, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton, New York.

“I call it the wettest hour in New York City, New York, for the record books,” Ramunni said. “We’re going to see additional rainfall through tonight as well so who knows what records may be broken here over the next 24 to 36 hours.”

Saturday’s downpour canceled a star-studded Homecoming concert in Central Park, when 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) of rain fell. The rainfall broke a record for the date that had endured since 1888.

Sunday was also another record breaker, with at least 2.24 inches (5.69 centimeters) having already fallen in the heart of New York city. The previous record for the day was 1.85 inches (4.7 centimeters), set in 1994.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee says the state is already moving into the recovery and assessment phase after Tropical Storm Henri, with the top priority being restore power to tens of thousands of residents and businesses.

The Democratic governor says National Grid already has crews out working on restoring electricity, and the goal is to get everyone back online by Tuesday.

“We are expecting temperatures in the 90s beginning Tuesday ... and that is why getting power restored is critical for the health and safety of our residents, our economy, and our small businesses,” he said at state emergency management headquarters in Cranston.

Terence Sobolewski, the president of National Grid Rhode Island, said it is expected to take a couple of days to get power fully restored.

The state has also started the process of assessing damage to get maximum reimbursement from the federal government, McKee said. He said on his tour of the state during the height of the storm, he did not see any major damage.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced he will be lifting a travel ban at 5 p.m. that went into effect on Sunday morning on all empty tractor trailers, tandem tractor trailers, and motorcycles on Interstate 95.

The Democrat urged people to stay off the road until the storm completely passes the state.

Storm-related flooding was blamed for major delays in the Hartford suburb of Wethersfield along Interstate 91, a major artery through Connecticut’s capital city.

Brian Foley, special assistant to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, said there was “water over the roadway on multiple lanes” and a couple accidents.

The northbound lane was closed for a short period and traffic was rerouted.

Eversource, Connecticut's largest electricity supplier, reported 32,902 of its 1.28 million customers in the state were without power as of mid-afternoon.

Communities in rural portions of eastern Connecticut had the largest proportion of power outages in the state by mid-afternoon on Sunday.

The small town of Canterbury had the largest percentage of customers without electricity, nearly 95%, according to Eversource. About 2,180 of the 2,305 were without power. Downed trees were to blame for many of the outages. In nearby Lisbon, 1,205 of the company’s 1,891 customers were without electricity.

“We’ve had trees come down on swimming pools and on several houses. But fortunately, none of those incidents resulted in anybody being hurt,” First Selectman Thomas Sparkman told NBC Connecticut.

Storm-related flooding from Henri has caused major delays in the Hartford suburb of Wethersfield along Interstate 91 northbound, a major artery through Connecticut’s capital city.

Brian Foley, special assistant to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, tweeted that traffic was reduced to one lane and there were multiple accidents.

Traffic cameras showed numerous vehicles backed up. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont on Twitter urged motorists to “avoid the area while crews work to address the situation.”

Tropical Storm Henri was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, and made landfall near Westerly, R.I., Sunday afternoon with sustained winds of about 60 mph and gusts of up to 70 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Henri has since weakened to sustained winds of 50 mph as it moves inland.

There were few early reports of major damage due to wind or surf, but officials warned of the danger of spot flooding in inland areas over the next few days.

Towns throughout New Jersey reported heavy rains and street flooding beginning Saturday night. Some places got as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) by midday Sunday.

Television video footage showed some spots where flash flooding or overflowing brooks had left numerous cars stranded, some with water up to their windows.

Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy told News 12NJ that the storm in the state had so far been a rain event but “a big rain event.” He said the state had been spared very windy conditions although the winds may pick up later. “It’s a good day to stay home,” he said, urging people to stay off the roads.

Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society, said Henri was reminiscent in some ways of Hurricane Harvey, a slow-moving storm that decimated the Houston area in 2017, exacerbated when bands of rain set up east of the city, a phenomenon meteorologists call “training.”

Rhode Island has reopened major bridges in the state to traffic but restrictions remain in place for some vehicles.

All roads to the beach community of Misquamicut remain closed because of wind-driven flooding. Misquamicut is a small cluster of beach hotels and vacation cottages and was heavily damaged by storm surge during Superstorm Sandy.

The National Weather Service's Boston office has reported about 75,000 customers without power in Rhode Island, about 20,000 customers out in Connecticut and nearly 6,900 customers out in Massachusetts.

The National Hurricane Center says Henri came ashore in the coastal town of Westerly around 12:30 p.m. It had earlier passed over Block Island, a small but popular tourist island 13 miles (21 kilometers) offshore in Block Island Sound.

Henri was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour), and it was producing 19-foot (5.8-meter) waves in some places just before making landfall.

Rhode Island has shut down major bridges in the state due to high winds.

All roads to the beach community of Misquamicut have been closed by authorities because of wind-driven flooding. Misquamicut is a small cluster of beach hotels and vacation cottages and was heavily damaged by storm surge during Superstorm Sandy.

The state is stitched together by bridges so shutting them down may mean people are trapped where they are until the storm passes.

National Grid is reporting 74,000 customers without power in Rhode Island and EverSource is reporting nearly 20,000 customers out in Connecticut.

Henri weakened slightly to a tropical storm early Sunday as it edged closer to landfall.

Millions of people on New York’s Long Island and in southern New England braced for flooding, toppled trees and extended power outages.

Henri was on course to crash into a long stretch of northeastern coastline by midday Sunday. The center of the storm was projected to pass over the eastern tip of Long Island.

Any special requirements about this report, please let us know and we can provide custom report.India on Sunday evacuated 392 people, including two Afghan lawmakers, in three different flights as part of its mission to bring back Indians and Afghan partners from Kabul amid a scramble by various nations to rescue their citizens from the war-ravaged country in the wake of deteriorating security situation and increasing Taliban hostilities.

Separately, 146 Indian nationals, who were evacuated from Afghanistan to Doha, are being repatriated to India on Sunday night, the Indian embassy in Qatar said this evening.

In the morning, a total of 168 people, including 107 Indians and 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were flown out of Kabul to Hindon airbase near Delhi in a C-17 heavy-lift military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) as the chaos continued at the airport in the Afghan capital.

Another group of 87 Indians and two Nepalese nationals were brought back in a special Air India flight from Dushanbe, a day after they were evacuated to the Tajikistan capital in an IAF 130J transport aircraft, officials said.

As many as 135 Indians, who were earlier evacuated from Kabul to Doha in the last few days by the US and NATO aircraft, were flown back from the Qatari capital city to Delhi in a special flight, they said.

''Bringing Indians back from Afghanistan. 2nd batch of 146 Indian nationals, who were evacuated from Afghanistan to Doha, being repatriated today to India,'' the Indian mission in Qatar tweeted at around 8 PM.

People familiar with the repatriation of the second batch of Indians from Doha said they will reach Delhi in four different flights which are scheduled to land in the national capital between 1.55 AM and 5.10 AM on Monday.

The 168 people evacuated from Kabul included Afghan lawmakers Anarkali Honaryar and Narender Singh Khalsa and their families, the people said.

''India is our second home. Even if we are Afghans and live in that country, people often call us Hindustanis. I thank India for extending its helping hand,'' Khalsa told reporters at the Hindon airbase near Delhi.

''I feel like crying. Everything is finished. It is a very difficult and painful decision to leave the country. We have not seen such a situation. Everything has been snatched away. It's all over,'' Khalsa said as he broke down when asked about the situation in Afghanistan.

With Sunday's evacuation, the number of people evacuated by India from Kabul reached around 590 since last Monday when the first group of people was evacuated, a day after the Taliban seized control of the city.

Taking to Twitter, Farid Mamundzay, Afghanistan ambassador to India, thanked Indian friends for their messages of support.

''I appreciate the kind words of sympathy and support messages from all Indian friends and the diplomatic missions in New Delhi over the suffering of Afghans in the past few weeks, particularly the last 7-8 days.

''The avoidable suffering of Afghanistan is man-made and at a scale beyond all civilized contemplation. Afghanistan is going through a difficult time, and only good leadership, compassionate attitude and international support to the Afghan people would somewhat bring an end to these miseries,'' he tweeted.

India carried out the evacuation missions in coordination with the US and several other friendly countries.

It is learnt that a small group of Indian officials is coordinating the evacuation mission at the Kabul airport, and another batch of Indians is expected to be brought back from the Afghan capital on Monday.

However, it will depend on whether a sizeable number of Indians, as well as Indian-origin people, manage to reach the airport.

People familiar with the situation in Kabul said Afghan nationals who are having Indian visas are facing increasing scrutiny from the Taliban.

''Evacuation continues! IAF special repatriation flight with 168 passengers on board, including 107 Indian nationals, is on its way to Delhi from Kabul,'' External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted hours before the plane landed at Hindon.

It is learnt that the Indians evacuated to Doha from Kabul were employees of a number of foreign companies that were operating in Afghanistan.

''Bringing Indians home from Afghanistan! AI 1956 carrying 87 Indians departs from Tajikistan for New Delhi. Two Nepalese nationals also evacuated.

''Assisted and supported by our Embassy @IndEmbDushanbe. More evacuation flights to follow,'' Bagchi tweeted at around 1:20 AM.

On the second batch of Indians returning home from Doha, the people cited above said 104 of them are being sent by a Vistara flight, 30 by a Qatar Airways flight and 11 of them will be reaching Delhi by an Indigo flight.

One person is returning by an Air India flight, they said.

Two days after the Taliban seized control of Kabul, India evacuated 200 people, including the Indian envoy and other staffers of its embassy in Kabul, in two C-17 heavy-lift transport aircraft of the IAF.

The first evacuation flight brought back over 40 people, mostly staffers at the Indian embassy, on Monday last.

The second C-17 aircraft evacuated around 150 people including Indian diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians from Kabul on Tuesday.

The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities, including Kabul, in the backdrop of the withdrawal of the US forces.

Following the evacuation, the MEA said the focus now would be to ensure the safe return of all Indian nationals from the Afghan capital.

The MEA said the immediate priority for the government is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently staying in Afghanistan.

It also requested the Indians, as well as their employers, to urgently share relevant details with the special Afghanistan cell that was set up on August 16.

Sources said the cell received more than 2,000 phone calls and answered over 6,000 WhatsApp queries during the first five days of its operation. The cell answered more than 1200 e-mails during the period.

According to a rough estimate last week, the number of Indians stranded in Afghanistan could be around 400, and India has been looking at ways to evacuate them including by coordinating with the US and other friendly countries.If You already have a subscription, please log in:

London start-up Inspira Pharmaceuticals emerged from stealth mode earlier this year to announce it had signed a deal with asthma technology firm Vectura. The pair are working on creating an inhalable version of Inspira’s Covid-19 treatment and are planning to kick off human trials for the treatment next year.

The show of support comes amid swirling questions over Vectura’s commercial partnerships and whether they could be put at risk by the expected takeover by Philip Morris, the world’s largest listed tobacco company and the maker of Marlboro cigarettes.

Health charities wrote to Vectura’s shareholders last week saying they should seize the opportunity to prove their commitment to ethical investing by blocking the takeover.Beth Entrup, owner of Healthy Hounds Canine Massage and More... in Quincy, recently completed training in Applied Acupressure Fundamentals at The Academy of Pet Careers in St. Louis.

In an Instagram Live video shared on Aug. 19, Soulja Boy proudly rocked an Atari fitted cap as he announced to his fans that he signed a deal with Atari and that is “now the owner of Atari” then declared himself the “first rapper to own a video game company.”

Atari set the record straight on their Twitter page that same day, refuting the rapper’s claims. “We know that CEO of Atari is a dream job, but that honor belongs to Wade Rosen,” reads a tweet from the brand’s account.

When word of the tweet made its way back to the “Turn My Swag On” artist, he made his feelings toward the company perfectly clear and nixed the idea of any future partnerships between them.

“F**k this contract! F**k Atari! Don’t call me no more. Don’t attach my name to y’all name b***h a** n***a, and I still got the money! Y’all sent me two contracts. Y’all said you wanted me to bring your company back because y’all was proud of what I did with Soulja Boy Game. Here go the contract right here, n***a!” he exclaimed while sharing a page of purported legal document with followers.

The profanity-laced rant continued with Soulja Boy continuing to stand firm on his claims that Atari came to him to “help” the company and reminding everyone that he doesn’t need them or their money.

Fans pointed out that Soulja may be in the wrong on this one because his initial claim was that he was the new head of the company, instead of promoting what, to them, seemed to be more of a marketing partnership.

“asking for help .. and becoming a CEO are two different things 😂 go off tho”

“Bro, the issue is that you said you were the CEO. Atari determined that was a lie. They wanted you for marketing purposes, you just didn’t read it.”

“Bro argues with someone new everyday how the the hell you gonna fight with the people who made Pac-Man”

Since the end of his short-lived relationship with Atari, the producer has returned to promoting his own game console system, Soulja Boy Game.The Taxi Dispatch Software Market study comprises a comprehensive market analysis that encompasses key aspects of the industry and defines current market dynamics in detail.

• Andee Harris has more than 20 years of experience leading new tech companies through growth stages.
• Her startup, Challenger Inc., is navigating a return to the office after 40% of employees moved away.
• She says some roles may be shifted or removed, but widening the talent pool is a big opportunity.

Andee Harris took over as CEO of the sales coaching and training startup Challenger, Inc. in January, 2021 — and still has yet to meet the majority of her new team in person. Oh, and that new team? During the pandemic, about 40% of them moved away.

Harris, an adjunct lecturer of innovation and entrepreneurship at Kellogg who has more than two decades' experience leading young technology companies through rapid-growth stages, knew that taking over a company during the pandemic would be tricky. But finding a new way of working as the nation, and many offices, reopen is proving more challenging than expected.

So what will reentry look like at Challenger, and what can other companies facing similar challenges learn from Harris's experience? Harris spoke with Kellogg Insight to share one startup's road back to the office.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Insight: So what does reentry look like at Challenger?

Harris: We have about 200 employees in the US, mostly based at our headquarter office in DC, and about 100 internationally, mostly in the UK.

The biggest surprise is that about 40% of our workforce moved during COVID-19. That really snuck up on us: individual managers knew, but there was no one at our organization gathering all that information.

Our workforce spans a wide age demographic. A lot of our younger employees moved back home just to save money. The DC area is fairly expensive, so a lot of them felt like why pay rent if they're just going to be holed up in little apartments? Then a lot of our 30-somethings, many of whom have young families, also moved to save money. They bought or rented homes in cheaper areas because they didn't have to be so close to the office. A lot of them have now resettled.

And then we had a whole group of employees who took it as an opportunity to live somewhere that they've always wanted to live. They moved to Colorado and California during the pandemic, and now want to stay.

Now we're trying to figure out how to wrangle the team, what the new normal looks like, and how to get people energized to be back at work.

This includes simple, tactical things like how we file unemployment in the different states where people live now. But now we also have to think about company culture. All of a sudden, a lot of members of our team have become remote workers. Do we let them stay remote?

Insight: This seems to be a big question in the tech industry. What steps are you taking to determine whom to bring back?

Harris: I hired a chief people officer because I knew this transition back was going to be really hard. We did have an HR generalist and a recruiter, but I felt like we really needed someone to focus on our people and culture.

So we're working with our chief people officer to figure out how we can transition collaboratively. Our policy is to have team members and their managers figure out if their jobs can be remote based on the parameters and expectations around the job.

For some of our employees, it's okay. But for others, it's not. To give you an example, our inside sales reps feed off of the energy of the office — you don't really want people making cold calls in the basement by themselves. But for our senior consultants, who are typically working with remote clients anyway, it's not as big of a deal.

But we're trying to be as sensitive as possible and slow roll into the return to work. Even for the people who are still in the DC area, the idea of coming back to the office five days a week is not landing very well — understandably. In these 12-plus months, people have adopted new behaviors.

Insight: How do you get people to want to return, whether for five days a week or even just a few? And is that return picture complicated by your status as a startup?

Harris: It's harder when you have a startup. The difference between a startup and a more mature company is a more mature company may still be growing, but they're growing at a much slower pace.

When you're trying to move really fast to scale a startup, it's a lot easier to have people right there, because you don't have a lot of the infrastructure and processes that a big company has in place. That gives you flexibility, but it makes a question like bringing a workforce back more complicated.

Insight: Do you feel like the answer is to bolster the infrastructure or to retain the flexibility? Or is it somewhere in between?

Harris: I think it's a combination of both. We are trying to be flexible, but not at a harm to our business. If we feel like someone being remote is a detriment to the business, or it doesn't make sense based on their job and their role, then we are trying to either transfer them to different departments or different roles — or transition them out.

Luckily our business model changed enough that we can still retain some of those employees even though they moved. We re-platformed our entire training system, so now people can swipe a credit card and do virtual training sessions. Before, training was pretty inaccessible unless you worked for a large company that had a pretty significant sales-training budget. This has enabled a lot of smaller businesses to access our training and coaching and allowed us to scale.

This has allowed us to switch some jobs that were always in-person to be remote.

Incidentally, we can now get talent all over the country, which is a change. We would typically not recruit outside of DC, Chicago, and the UK. It's great that we have a much bigger talent pool. I think a lot of companies are excited about that opportunity.

But now we don't want to just mandate that everyone come back to the office. Instead, we have to decide what to do with this huge office in DC. Do we need that office space? Does it make sense? We had a satellite office in Chicago, and we let the lease lapse during COVID-19.

We're trying to figure out: What does our new office space look like, and what do we need it to do? We're thinking about creative solutions to bring people together that don't necessarily involve them physically working together.

Insight: You're really asking a fundamental question, which is: What's the function of socialization within the organization, and how can that be achieved in ways that are not necessarily the same as they have been in the past?

Harris: Companies and leaders have to look at it differently. I still think it's important that teams are together, and that there's bonding and collaboration. I still think that most conflict in the workplace could be resolved through better communication.

I was brought on as CEO at Challenger during COVID-19, so I've been remote the entire time. I met my leadership team, but I haven't met most of the people I work with. I'm still a little bit of a stranger to them. If this were a normal time, I would've met the entire team by now, and would've had lunches and drinks with them, and gotten to know how many kids they have, and what they like to do for fun.

I can pick up on people's energy when I'm in person with them. Over Zoom , it's harder. And so, I can often say like, "Hey, it looks like you're having a rough day. Are you feeling okay?" And as a CEO, it's really important to be able to tune into that.

I think that it's important that we get back together. I don't think anything replaces that human connection. But I'm not advocating that people need to be in the office five days a week.

Insight: You lead a company that trains other companies, which might give you a particularly interesting perspective on this question: How do you see other companies responding to the challenges of bringing people together without them physically being together?

Harris: Not surprisingly, we've seen other companies as well as ours invest heavily in technology and people to fill this gap, things like paying for employees to get better internet and investing in Zoom and Microsoft Teams.

Intra-office relationships drive competition, obligation to the team, and a sense of urgency to succeed. We have found that these bonds — made through team lunches, happy hours, and "watercooler" chats — improve employee retention and overall engagement, especially for young salespeople. Over the past year and a half, companies have needed to restore that engagement through other means. Virtual happy hours are great, but companies realized it would take much more to build a fair and motivating environment. Some made major changes to compensation plans to improve extrinsic motivation. Some changed their hiring strategies and assessed future employees on different behavioral traits than in the past, such as proof of their ability to work autonomously and stay self-motivated. Managers needed to increase their overall communication and the quality of their coaching and training sessions.

As important as that internal shift has been, a larger challenge for companies was in how they managed their interactions with external clients. Think about an account manager who used to go on-site with a customer for days or even weeks at a time. Yes, they would spend most of that time on project work, but much of that time was spent on relationship-building activities. Suddenly, an eight-hour project day was cut down to four — and then divided into 30-minute Zoom sessions to accomplish specific tasks relating to that project. Sellers who had relied heavily on relationship-based selling suffered immensely. So companies are reevaluating how they train sellers to sell and consultants to consult. As customer conversations changed, client-facing employees needed to change, too.

Harris: We are really focusing on appreciation of our employees — just really going above and beyond to let our employees know that we care. We've launched a lot of initiatives around that.

Leaders and companies are going to have to be very empathetic as people transition out of this. There are going to be a lot of lasting effects of COVID-19, whether it's people with long-hauler syndrome, people who lost loved ones, lost jobs. As companies, we need to be supportive of our employees' mental health.Shovels in hand, covered in dust, they work in the sandy soil above Libby Creek in the Kootenai National Forest. Like so many before them, they search the hillside and creek for the flakes of fortune that have drawn people to the remote stream since the 1860s.

While finding gold is the ultimate goal of the Northwest Montana Gold Prospectors, the group says friendship is the most valuable fortune they find in the hills.

“Getting together out here once a month is a chance for people to get a little gold and be with other people who enjoy prospecting as well. It’s not as much about the gold as it is about getting together with folks and having a good time,” Sandy Randall, the group’s president, told the Daily Inter Lake. “We are not in it to make money. We are here to have fun and to get people involved, especially kids.”

Based in Columbia Falls, the nonprofit organization has been helping people get interested in prospecting since its founding in 1995 by Clarence and Jill Taber.

The group began leasing small claims adjacent to the Libby Creek Recreational Gold Panning Area in 1996 and bought out those claims in 2003.

Located 23 miles south of Libby, the land surrounding the Libby Creek area has been of interest to prospectors since the early 1860s, when it was home to up to 600 miners working at a camp known as Libbysville.

By 1876, only one miner was reported to be working the creek, but a second gold rush in 1885 brought another wave of miners to a new camp known as Lake City or Oldtown. A store in the mining camp was supplied by a packstring that brought supplies via a trail from Thompson Falls. Mining on the Creek hit its peak from 1889 to 1909.

​​Hydraulic mining operations began around 1909 and continued until the late 1940s, when mining activities in the area began to trail off.

The current gold panning area was acquired through a land exchange in 1987 and opened to the public the following year.

With their claim just a short walk from Libby Creek, the Northwest Montana Gold Prospectors are continuing a 160-year tradition of prospecting in the area.

The Northwest Montana Gold Prospectors started as a local group of mining and prospecting enthusiasts, but over the years it has seen hundreds of members from across the country. These days, it has about 60 active members.

“Some people stay members forever, and then there are some that we see for a few years and then we never see them again,” group secretary Don Roe Jr. said. “There are also the one-and-dones. They come up here on summer vacation and join the club. Many of them pay their club dues every year, but they never come back. I think part of it is just being able to tell people they have a gold claim in Montana.”

The group began working its claim with shovels and buckets and slowly progressed to the current operation, which includes the monthly rental of an excavator and up to nine trommel screens that help sift the material.

Currently, the group spends one weekend a month in the summer and two weekends in September getting together to search their claim for gold, splitting their haul equally at the end of each outing.

Randall's association with the group began in 1998 when she got interested in metal detecting and began looking for a place to pursue her new hobby. After speaking with Jill Taber at her shoe store in Columbia Falls, Randall decided to join the Northwest Montana Gold Prospectors for one of their Libby Creek outings, where she found a small nugget about the size of her pinky fingernail.

“After that, you couldn’t get me away from here. I have been hooked ever since I found that first piece of gold,” she said. “Some people say I am lucky, but it is more of a combination of patience and tenacity.”

While the majority of finds are not nearly that large, Randall says there are still some “pretty darn nice pieces of gold” to be found at Libby Creek.

Between food, gasoline and the cost of renting the excavator, each monthly outing costs the organization around $1,300, which the group offsets with the spoils of its labor.

“We are all out here to find gold, but it is more about the friendships that come out of these get-togethers,” Randall said. “The gold is nice, but friendships made out here are the real treasures.”The Ministry of Finance has summoned Infosys MD and CEO, Salil Parekh, on Monday over continuing glitches in the new income tax e-filing portal. The issue was flagged off by none other than Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Parekh will personally explain to the Finance Minister the reason for the persistent glitches. The Finance Minister had earlier asked Infosys to work on the portal to make it more humane and user-friendly and expressed her deep concern about the various problems being faced by the stakeholders.

In a recent tweet, the Income Tax Department said that the portal is not available since Saturday, August 21. The summons followed thereafter.

"Ministry of Finance has summoned Sh Salil Parekh, MD & CEO @Infosys on 23/08/2021 to explain to hon'ble FM as to why even after 2.5 months since launch of new e-filing portal, glitches in the portal have not been resolved. In fact, since 21/08/2021 the portal itself is not available," the department said.

The new income tax e-filing portal developed by Infosys was launched on June 7 in a bid to ease the tax filing process and expedite the refund issue.

However, taxpayers have been facing several problems in using the portal since its inception.

In July, the Union Finance Ministry asked the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to constitute a seven-member task force to look into the technical issues facing the new Income Tax e-filing portal developed by Infosys.

In line with the directive, the ICAI constituted a team to analyse the issues.

During the recent Monsoon Session of Parliament, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha that Infosys has been paid a total of Rs 164.5 crore under the project.

So far, Nandan Nilekani, the non-executive chairman of Infosys, has been reporting to Ms Sitharaman on a weekly basis. Expressing regrets for the glitches, Nilekani had said they would be resolved in a matter of days.Angela Kyerematen-Jimoh has been sworn in by President Akufo-Addo as a member of the Governing Board of the Bank of Ghana.

A flawed but vital tax incentive programme for venture capital known as Section 12J (S12J) was terminated at end-June, yet there is nothing to replace it.

Hundreds of small firms and start-ups were boosted by S12J, which enabled taxpayer to channel part of their tax liability into an approved investment.

Instead of their taxes being swallowed up and disappearing into the black hole of the fiscus, which is not exactly noted for the efficient management of our taxes, the money could instead be used to back a business, with the investor reaping healthy rewards if the investment was a success.

S12J was criticised for the way in which some vanity projects were funded, but most projects it has brought to life have been worthwhile and sustainable businesses — largely black-owned, often in townships or rural areas, and always helping tackle this country’s shameful scar of mass unemployment.

The future of venture capital in SA is uncertain without these S12J incentives. So what is to be done? If the government does not want to give incentives to support small businesses it should compensate for this by removing regulatory barriers these businesses face.

Try to launch a business and you will be swamped by an avalanche of onerous red tape. It does not matter whether you are big or small; the burden is equally daunting. Regulators require you to incur costs upfront — before you can start to bring in any income. This can destroy any hope for budding entrepreneurs, tripping them up at the first hurdle.

I am referring to licensing requirements and similar obstacles. Before you can raise a cent you have to go through a lot of cash burn, which prolongs the hazardous start-up phase before you can reach break even. It can be, and often is, fatal.

It is an enormous problem if all scarce resources are required to meet regulatory requirements instead of being able to focus on getting the business off the ground through attention to marketing and sales. From a financing point of view a red tape mountain is a barrier to getting a small business in place, since so many unproductive costs have had to be funded.

Surely the regulatory bodies should behave much more as nurturing bodies, rather than as policing bodies, regarding small businesses? Ask any small businessperson: they are far from nurturing.

What about the investors, the venture capitalists? Without the S12J carrot, and facing the stick of red tape and bureaucracy, moving into other parts of Africa is looking attractive. Venture capital is starting to flee SA as the government has shut down the vital support S12J was offering.

SA is a far worse location for start-ups than the environment in our neighbours. The obstacles and barriers that are a hindrance to establishing and operating a business in SA do not exist in jurisdictions such as Botswana, Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius or Namibia. Even Nigeria is starting to move up the global competitiveness ladder.

In these more business-friendly emerging market environments the potential of entrepreneurship can more easily be converted into opportunity. This is a shame, as the latest unemployment numbers illustrate anew the desperate need for the creation of new businesses to offer new employment opportunities.

SA’s formal unemployment rate of well more than 30% — double that level for young people — is a direct consequence of too few SMEs. So where are these SMEs that need to be formed? They are shut out even before they can get going, or are set up for failure.Hyderabad: Freemasons of Telangana conducted the sixth round of Gift-A-Livelihood, an initiative to aid petty traders with tools and equipments to restart their livelihood which they lost due to Covid, in the city.

The programme, which was started in August 2020, had helped about 180 people restart their businesses. Speaking on the occasion, Rajeev Khandelwal, the National Head of Freemasonry, said that although the Covid cases have decreased, the members of the society will continue to help those in need.

“Since the start of the pandemic last year, the Masonic Fraternity has worked on several projects. We have been actively involved in the construction of polyclinics, schools, medical care centres and electrification of remote rural India. We also constructed a shed for the cyclone victims in Andhra Pradesh. In fact, members of Freemasonry in south India have done charities worth Rs 3 crore during the Covid times,” he said.

He also participated in the portrait unveiling of VG Madhusudan, the Regional Grand Master, Regional Grand Lodge of South India.

The tepid subscription to its initial public offering is also likely to impact listing, experts feel. The Rs 5,000-crore IPO was subscribed 1.71 times during August 9-11, largely supported by qualified institutional buyers whose reserved portion saw 4.23 times subscription. The issue price has been fixed at Rs 570 per share.

The response from non-institutional investors (66 percent) and retail investors (73 percent) was weak. In fact, this was the first IPO where retail portion subscription was below 100 percent amongst IPOs launched in second half of CY21.

"It looks like the market sentiments turned IPO fever down to discount for new listings. There are high expectations that Nuvoco could see a discount or muted opening, as risk concerns weigh more over positive rationales," Prashanth Tapse, VP Research at Mehta Equities told Moneycontrol.

"New investors will always remain concerned when it comes to applying in IPO which has large portion of offer for sale as a result we can see muted subscription figures. Muted listing seems to be justified high debt on books and inconsistent financial performance in last 3 years," he said.

The public offer of Nuvoco Vistas Corporation comprised a fresh issue of Rs 1,500 crore and an offer for sale of Rs 3,500 crore by promoter Niyogi Enterprise. The net proceeds from fresh issue will be utilised for repaying of debts.

"Nuvoco Vista Corporation, a part of Nirma Group Company, is among one of the largest cement companies, however listing gains are not much attractive," said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research

Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities also expects flat listing for Nuvoco Vistas Corporation.

The company offers a range of over 50 products across cement, RMX (ready mix concrete) and modern building materials. Its cement production capacity constituted approximately 4.2 percent of the total cement capacity in India as of December 2020, and also, it is one of the leading ready-mix concrete manufacturers with 49 RMX plants across India.

As of March 2021, it has 11 cement plants (eight in East India and three in North India), having an installed capacity of 22.32 million tonnes per annum (MMTPA).

The offences include non-compliance relating to requirements of filing statutory documents and returns, appointing a designated partner responsible for all compliances and having at least one resident partner for the LLP, the official cited above said on condition of anonymity.

The ministry of corporate affairs will notify the requirements for startup LLPs to avail of this relief. One of them is that the startup needs to be recognized as one by the department for promotion and internal trade (DPIIT), the person mentioned above said.

“This relief is expected to encourage small unincorporated businesses to adopt LLP form and become part of the formal economy,” the official said.

An email sent to the secretary in the ministry and to the spokesperson remained unanswered till the time of going to press. The reduced penalty is available to the entity and the partners, including the designated partner and other persons liable to pay the penalty.

The other offences for which the reduced penalty would apply include lapses in reporting changes in partners of an LLP, filling the vacancy of a designated partner in time, maintaining a registered office, informing the authorities about address changes, and disclosing details about the firm in its official communications.

Since these are procedural and technical lapses and do not show any intent to defraud the public, an in-house administrative system will be available to settle them. DPIIT defines a startup as a business with less than ₹100 crore sales, which should be working towards innovation and improvement of services and should have the potential to generate jobs.

The amendment to the LLP Act passed by Parliament in the recently concluded monsoon session decriminalized offences that are procedural in nature as part of efforts to improve the ease of doing business.In the most fun card game a baseball fan as big as he is could play, Stephen Olson is potentially holding a miracle hand. He just needs to be dealt two more cards to complete it.

Tucked away somewhere in a drawer inside his desk in Santa Rosa, California, Olson has a dozen century-old postcards, carefully preserved. Even among cards that age, they’re considered rare. Sell them, and Olson might be able to pocket enough to purchase a new sports car, or some season tickets with a breathtaking view of the bay at San Francisco’s Oracle Park.

But he’s not getting in touch with sports writers at the newspaper in Scranton to brag, or to try to cash in on a treasure.

“What fun would that be?” Olson asks with a laugh during a telephone interview when asked if he’d ever dream of selling what he’s got.

Fun would be getting the miracle flop, finding the dealer to lead him to those two cards — Jocko Halligan and E.J. Coleman — to complete the set of 14 known players and, in the card-collecting world, what indeed would be considered among the rarest of collections.

For the last 15 years, the 73-year-old semiretired attorney has been not only seeking the 13th and 14th cards he needs to finish it off, but finding out that doing so has always been seen as a challenge.

His dozen cards were created sometime between 1908 and 1909 by the Rose Company, a Philadelphia postcard maker at the turn of the century that produced cards of players from the 16 teams in the major leagues of the time as well as members of the 1908 New York State League champion — the Scranton Miners.

Because the team is an exception — they’re the only minor-league team included in the set — and because the cards are rare, they’re considered almost a holy grail in the bustling world of card collecting.

So, Olson is turning here for the help he has been seeking on and off for the last 15 years. Because if there are any spare Jocko Halligan and E.J. Coleman cards awaiting discovery in a shoebox or attic, it’s most likely they’ll be found where the mystery of their very existence began.

He grew up in Jamestown, New York, following the Detroit Tigers’ Class D minor league team as a teenager. His father was a high school classmate of Stan Musial; he even got to meet the great Cardinals slugger at his St. Louis restaurant on the Olson family’s cross-country vacation in 1958.

Like most young Americans gripped by the national pastime in the 1950s and ’60s, Olson collected baseball cards by the bike-basketful.

“And also like most my age, my mother threw out some that would probably be quite valuable today,” Olson laughed, still fawning over the beauty of his long-gone Sandy Koufax rookie card. “And others, I clipped to my bicycle so they would make noise in the spokes.”

As an adult, he moved to Pittsburgh, practicing law for decades in the shadow of Three Rivers Stadium and the great Pirates teams of the ’70s, and even as he aged, his love of baseball was well known among family members.

That’s why his brother thought of him when he saw that group of 12 cards at an estate sale in the first half of the 1990s.

First time Olson looked at them, he knew he had … something.

It didn’t take much research to learn they were created by the Rose Co., but learning a bit about the players, most of whom he never knew existed, took a bit more effort. He did know one player, though: A 32-year-old outfielder named Archibald “Moonlight” Graham, who played more than 250 games in Scranton. Seventy years after that final season of Graham’s professional career, the blockbuster film “Field of Dreams” immortalized his career and the only half-inning he ever played in the major leagues with the New York Giants in 1905.

Outside of Graham, the Scranton cards in Olson’s pile featured long-forgotten players like Heinie Beckendorf and Lew Groh, Charles Moran and Gus Zeime.

He stashed them away, then took them out again after he moved west, to California and wine country.

Only, his search for the Halligan and Coleman cards hit dead end after dead end. He never so much as got a lead on their potential whereabouts, never mind a road map to get his hands on them.

“I mean, these postcards are super rare,” said Kevin Struss, a dealer and longtime collector in Laguna Beach, California, who has the only known complete set of Scranton cards from the Rose Co. “The average Rose Company postcard, there’s only three or four copies known to exist. The Scranton players, in particular, are rarer than the American League and National League players.”

Baseball cards are life for John Odell, who spends his days surrounded by some of the most coveted cards ever produced.

The curator of research and history at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, Odell got to live a dream when he worked as lead curator on the Hall’s spectacular Shoebox Treasures exhibit, which details the history of baseball cards. Its collection offers museumgoers a chance to see some of the most valuable cards in existence, including the T206 Honus Wagner tobacco card, one of which sold for $3.75 million at auction in May.

But when he hears about Olson’s collection of Scranton cards from the Rose Co. — card collectors know it as the PC716 series — even Odell fawns just a little.

“To my mind, they are more attractive and interesting than the more famous T206s,” he raved.

“The set itself is so interesting,” he went on. “It’s so beautiful. … It’s almost like getting sort of a matted portrait.”

Rose Co. postcards commemorated holidays, historic events, famous actors and, of course, major leaguers. They made blank forms of the baseball cards, presumably so buyers could put their own photo in the circle and feel like a major leaguer, if they chose. Plus, they were larger, more substantial — and more kid friendly — than the T206 tobacco cards that were all the rage in the summer of 1908.

The major league portion of the set featured an early Ty Cobb card, two Christy Mathewson cards and what is considered Walter Johnson’s only true rookie card.

Not bad for a nickel per card, or a quarter for anyone who wanted to splurge for the whole set during the Theodore Roosevelt administration.

They’re so rare, Odell said the Hall of Fame has only four examples of the cards in its collection, most notably one of Philadelphia A’s pitcher Chief Bender. PSA, a renowned sports authentication and grading service, considers cards from the collection “very scarce.” In collecting, that means very valuable.

A Mathewson card from the set sold for more than $18,000 at auction last December. Cobb cards have gone for even more. Struss estimates a Moonlight Graham card, the existence of which he calls “a small miracle,” could top five figures at auction.

Those 1908 Miners were quite a story locally that summer, dazzling fans and overwhelming opponents at the dusty Brooks Athletic Field, which sat where Scranton High School’s Veterans Memorial Stadium now stands.

Manager Malachi Kittridge’s Miners finished the season 84-51, a franchise record for wins that stood for 35 years, long past the point when Yankees slugger Babe Ruth’s penchant for slugging home runs changed the way teams like the Miners played the game decades earlier.

One vestige of the dead-ball era that did survive into the 1930s was card collecting, Odell said. But for 10 of the 14 Miners players whose faces were immortalized in the Rose Co.’s set, this mysterious series remained their only one.

They were first printed in the summer of 1908, weeks before the Miners sealed the league title by outlasting the likes of the Binghamton Bingoes and the Utica Pent-Ups. So, winning the championship doesn’t seem to have been a factor. Perhaps proximity to the Rose Co. and Philadelphia had something to do with it, but the Wilkes-Barre Barons were in the league, too, and even nearer to company headquarters.

So today, the reason these cards were produced can be little more than theory.

“And I think it will be forever, at this point, unless we find correspondence from the Rose Company from 110 years ago,” Odell said.

One of the few collectors in the nation who have focused intently on the PC716 set, Struss believes the Miners cards weren’t distributed nationally with the AL and NL players, but rather were part of a subset distributed in and around Scranton. The fact that he just doesn’t see that many of them is one clue. Another is that the few he has seen actually used as postcards are postmarked from Scranton.

The best clue may be in one of the cards Olson needs.

Eddie “E.J.” Coleman was one of the most popular men in Scranton at the turn of the century, a politician, county sheriff, restaurateur and friend of the stars — heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey was often a guest at the Coleman home on the 700 block of North Webster Avenue in the city. Philadelphia A’s manager Connie Mack also was a close friend.

In 1908, Coleman was also sole owner of the Miners, and he’s the only nonplayer with a card in the Rose Co. set. It’s conceivable his ability to promote his businesses and the city led to a deal with the Rose Co. to build excitement around his championship team.

Whatever the reason, two of those cards remain outside Olson’s grasp, and he knows it’s most likely that, if there are any unknown stragglers, they’re here.

If you have them, he’d sure like to talk.PORT ANGELES — Here is this week’s schedule for the 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Todd Ortloff Show on KONP 1450 am, 101.7 fm in Port Angeles, 101.3 fm in Sequim and myclallamcounty.com on the internet outside the Port Angeles area.

Monday – Singer and former contestant on The Voice, Ericka Corban, discusses her upcoming free concert at Studio Bob.Andrew McDowell, who owns a cafe in downtown Los Angeles, says the recall election of Gov. Gavin Newsom is a waste of time and money.

It's not that he's a big fan of Newsom. It's that Newsom is up for reelection next year, so why spend the time and money now?

McDowell says the $276 million to hold the Sept. 14 election should be spent instead on grants for small businesses that are struggling. "If we were running California as a business, we would not be wasting these kinds of funds on these things that truly are not going to impact the bottom line long term."

Even though his business suffered during the COVID-19 shutdowns, McDowell also cuts Newsom some slack on dealing with an unprecedented crisis.

"We didn't bring on a governor to bring us through a pandemic, but to run our normal day-to-day. Then they're put into this furnace and we say, ‘Hey, you really didn't do a good job,'" McDowell said.

"I think really our view on our governor's performance should be, what has he tried, what has he learned? Is he getting better? And not hold people 100% to mistakes — even stupid publicity mistakes."

Recall proponents and the Republicans who want to become the next governor aren't nearly as forgiving.

Some criticize Newsom's pandemic safety measures as overly restrictive and devastating to small businesses. Others call him a hypocrite by citing the infamous French Laundry dinner that he attended mask-less during a statewide indoor dining ban and by repeating false claims that the winery he founded stayed open.

For some business owners, the pain during the pandemic adds to longstanding frustrations over the cost of living in California, which could motivate them to vote to recall Newsom. The main advocacy group for small businesses, however, is not taking a position on the recall given its members differing views.

For his part, Newsom — who styles himself an entrepreneur — has taken some action to help small business owners, including tax breaks for business owners who received federal relief loans. Using a huge state budget surplus and a gusher of federal aid, the governor also pushed the largest economic stimulus ever, which included $2 billion in grants to 180,939 small businesses and nonprofits, according to California's Office of the Small Business Advocate. An additional three rounds of funding were announced at the end of July, bringing the total to $4 billion.

The state also tried to help small businesses sell online, while providing free masks and hand sanitizer.

But not everyone received grants — or it wasn't enough to keep them in business. In California, nearly 40,000 small businesses had closed by September 2020, according to Yelp data analyzed by the New York Times.

The businesses hit hardest by state and county stay-at-home orders lacked an online presence and had small cash reserves — typical of small businesses, according to the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. The impact in Los Angeles County was particularly pronounced, where, according to 2019 Census data, 88% of businesses had fewer than 20 employees — places such as restaurants, bars and hair salons.

For proponents of the recall election, the shutdowns and Newsom's support of a law that forced employers to offer benefits to gig workers were among reasons to remove him from office.

The Republican candidates are courting small business owners, primarily by bashing the governor's approach to managing the coronavirus, but also by offering some proposals of their own.

Kevin Faulconer, a former mayor of San Diego, says he would lift COVID-related business capacity limits and proposed a small restaurant relief fund.

Larry Elder, a radio host and former small business owner, has emphasized the impact of crime on small businesses and has been outspoken about his opposition to a minimum wage.

John Cox, also a former small business owner, has pledged tax cuts to make California more business-friendly, while Kevin Kiley, an Assemblymember from Rocklin, says he would use executive powers to roll back burdensome regulations like those on gig workers. Kiley and Caitlyn Jenner have spoken out against a state law that allows employees to sue and recover civil penalties for labor code violations.

Meanwhile, Democrat Kevin Paffrath, a real estate agent and host of a YouTube show on finance, has a platform of streamlined permitting for businesses.

The policy positions held by Elder and Kiley, in particular, appeal to some small business owners. They include Baret Lepejian, whose Burbank restaurant was fenced up by the city for a violation of public health orders — an allegation he denies.

Lepejian bought Tinhorn Flats, a longtime Burbank fixture, in 2004, but he's unlikely to reopen it, at least not in the city. Its closure has fueled his motivation to vote Newsom out.

"The one thing that I say over and over again to everyone I meet in person is that none, and I mean none of this, is about public safety," he said. "It's 100% about power and control, that's what's going on."

​​Brianna Knight, a 31-year-old Fresno resident with clients across the state, was one of the fortunate ones. Her holistic skincare business has done well during the pandemic.

The state grants helped, but so did her "overplanning" — six months ahead at some points. Before the pandemic, Knight also launched a clinical skincare line, enabling her to package at-home facial kits for her clients once COVID-19 hit.

Despite staying afloat, Knight said she is undecided how she will vote on the recall. She said she needs to research the candidates more, and wants to see how the next phase of the pandemic goes.

"I definitely think that we need new leadership, but I don't know if right now is the time," she said. "And I only say that because right now California is in the purple (COVID tier) and we do foresee a possible shutdown again. So transitioning leadership right now — sometimes it gets worse."

Knight said she wants new leadership because of the way the pandemic was handled, including shutting down businesses that state leaders deemed non-essential.

"I do corrective skincare, so acne, so even in a pandemic, those clients are still dealing with an issue," she said. "I think that what they considered wasn't as important — was important to a lot of people, and we weren't recognized."

Knight said the back-and-forth on closures — California started back-tracking just weeks after the June 15 grand reopening — didn't help.

"There has to be consistency in business, to some extent," she said. "Change is inevitable, but when it comes to things like this, I felt it wasn't handled as well as it could have been handled."

Federal assistance was a big help last year, added McDowell, the L.A. cafe owner, but this year, there has been less aid available. That means small business owners like him are still struggling.

"Everyone has the sense that everything was fine again and back to normal," he said. "And that just was never the case."

Cecilia Vazquez, 54, who had to close her jewelry store in the University Heights area of San Diego County for four months. But like McDowell, she doesn't place the blame squarely on Newsom.

"I don't think anybody was ready. Nobody really knew what to do," said Vazquez, whose shop was recently visited by Jenner. "We were all trying to do our best."

Thousands of small business owners across California are still trying to survive a pandemic now in its fourth surge. Even with the reopening, some restaurants and other service establishments are having trouble hiring workers — or are having to pay more and offer perks.

Then, there are businesses that also have to deal with wildfires and drought.

Data from San Francisco-based software company Womply showed that the deadly 2018 Camp Fire resulted in 13% of local businesses near the fire shutting down permanently, while in 2019, 6.6% of businesses closed after the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County.

In 2020, California experienced its most destructive fire season in history, with 4.2 million acres burned. In 2021 so far, it isn't much better. The still-burning Dixie Fire is already the second largest in state history, having blackened more than 600,000 acres in Butte, Plumas, Lassen and Tehama counties.

Meanwhile, California is in the grip of its worst drought since 2015. Last week, Newsom raised the prospect of mandatory water conservation statewide.

John Kabateck, California director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said opinions on the recall vary among its members, but many are too busy dealing with bigger concerns. Among them: finding qualified employees, meeting payroll and readying for a "huge spike" in their unemployment insurance taxes.

"The one thing that we have a duty to provide small business owners during difficult times — during any time — is predictability and certainty," Kabateck said in an interview Wednesday. "Certainly the pandemic, the wildfire, the drought — all of these things, whether they are natural or man-made — are creating fear and uncertainty in your average small employer. We're choosing to concentrate our time and resources on helping these mom-and-pops through these difficult times."

James Long, who lives in McKinleyville in Humboldt County and owns a security services company, said he doesn't think any governor — Democrat or Republican — would have been able to successfully navigate the many crises that hit the state.

So he's willing to give Newsom the benefit of the doubt.

"He'd just become governor, and then this pandemic hit. Then all hell broke loose," Long said. "Then we've got all these other problems, we've got the wildfire. Let's not dump on the man."The City of Edmonton has approved a new business licence bylaw it says will reduce barriers for new businesses in the city.

The new bylaw will come into effect in January 2022. It includes better guidance on how people can apply for a business licence, clearer language to help businesses find what they need and an option to get a business licence for two years instead of just one.

The city said the bylaw is one of several improvements underway to help streamline the permitting, licensing and regulatory process.

“A new, modern and robust business licence bylaw helps create the conditions for businesses to thrive and prosper as envisioned by the City Plan,” said Kim Petrin, branch manager of development services.

Lyla Peter with the City of Edmonton added the previous bylaw wasn’t very flexible or adaptable to support new business models.

“As a city, we really do want to work with and support our business environment and we want to make sure that businesses have the ability to thrive in our city,” Peter said.

David Egan is the co-owner of Transit Smokehouse & BBQ. Located in the iconic Transit Hotel on Fort Road, the smokehouse was set to open nine months ago. However, the tables and bar stools remain empty.

Egan said he didn’t realize how many roadblocks he would run into when it came to dealing with the city on things like obtaining permits and licences. Obtaining his business licence alone set back the restaurant’s opening date by four months, he said.

“It became so obstructing to us that we reached a point — several times — that we might just run out of money,” Egan said.

While the new bylaw is too late to help him, Egan is hopeful it will help reduce red tape for fellow business owners, as he patiently awaits the city to approve a permit for his smoker.

“This new bylaw places fixed timelines on the business licence granting process and that has been one of many holdups,” Egan explained.

“It’s felt like we are a few weeks away for the last six months,” he said of the opening date.

Other changes to the bylaw include incentives for businesses that renew their licence on time, a simplified fee schedule and new licence categories.

For more information on the new bylaw, visit the City of Edmonton’s website.Mr Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Bui Power Authority (BPA), managers of the Bui hydro-electric power station, says his administration will build on the dam’s power generating capacity to augment electricity supply.

Interacting with Journalists during a visit to the dam’s plant site on Friday, Mr Dzamesi said the dam’s solar project remained a priority and he would ensure its expansion for enhanced power generation.

He said the Bui dam remained a key national asset and he would continue to put in place more pragmatic measures to protect it.

Mr Dzamesi, a former Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, indicated employees’ working conditions and relationships were also a priority and promised his administration would work hard to improve on that.

He commended Mr Fred Oware, the outgoing CEO of the Authority, for his exceptional leadership, which he noted had deepened the BPA’s relationship with the communities around the Bui dam enclave.

“I have toured many of the communities around the enclave and I highly appreciated the praises showered on Mr Oware for his exceptional leadership and several innovations designed to better the lives of the dam’s affected people,” he said.

Describing the media as a powerful tool and pre-requisite for development, Mr Dzamesi pledged to deepen the working relationship with the media and advised practitioners to bring more positive stories than negatives.

On his part, Mr Oware explained he was happy to serve the BPA and cherished his long-standing relationship with employees and the local communities.

 He expressed the hope the new CEO would build and strengthen that relationship as well as build on his legacies.

He said because the dam’s power generation depended on the level of water in the Black Volta, there was the need for the Authority to prioritise its renewable energy project.

The solar project, Mr Oware indicated, could add more power to the dam’s originally designed 400 megawatts and hoped the new CEO would expand the project in the supreme interest of the nation.Two hospitality businesses in the north and north-east have been forced to close due to the impact of the coronavirus.

The Westhill Chip Shop on Tower Road in Inverness has said that it will be closing permanently due the challenges of the pandemic.

Owners of the chip shop shared on social media that its last day of trading will be next week on Sunday, August 29.

They wrote: “Unfortunately, we have decided to close the chippy. Two lockdowns and now major supplier issues have taken a toll on us.

“The shop will still be opening after next Sunday, but will be back to being The Codfather. The staff and myself would like to thank all our customers over the past two years, without you all we would have never made it this far.”

Meanwhile, The Cult of Coffee in the Rosemount area of Aberdeen will be temporarily closed due to staff having to self-isolate.

The contact from track and trace has left the small team with staff shortages, so they will be closing their doors until they can all return to work.

In a post on Facebook, the coffee shop apologised for the inconvenience caused by the closure and thanked its customers for their “incredible support”.

Since the move beyond Level 0 on August 9, the number of daily cases reported in Scotland have been gradually rising.

The move brought new guidelines into force surrounding self-isolation which meant close contacts no longer had to “automatically” isolate at home for 10 days.

Anyone who is double-vaccinated for at least two weeks and has no symptoms can end their isolation period if they have a negative PCR test result.

The track and trace system is continuing to be used in public places which is having an impact on many businesses, such as The Cult of Coffee.

The new rules also apply to schools with whole classes no longer having to self-isolate if one person tests positive.

Instead, contact tracing is being prioritised to prevent the spread of the virus.

Just one week into the new term, Ellon Academy has confirmed a positive case within the school.

A letter shared on the school website confirmed that close contacts will be contacted by Test and Protect and that the school will remain open within government guidelines.WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is raising concerns that the Islamic State poses a threat as American troops seek to evacuate thousands of U.S. citizens and Afghan allies from Afghanistan.

Biden in remarks at the White House on Sunday noted that the terror group is a “sworn enemy of the Taliban” and said that the longer U.S. troops are on the ground increases the chance that the group will attempt to strike innocent civilians and American personnel near the Hamid Karzai International Airport.

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has been warning Americans to avoid traveling to the airport in part because of concerns about Islamic State fighters.

The extremist group has long declared a desire to attack America and U.S. interests abroad and it has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority.

The group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, and faced Taliban attacks.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says 11,000 individuals were evacuated from Kabul over the weekend and he remains committed to assisting all Americans who want to leave Afghanistan get out.

Biden added Sunday that his first priority is getting American citizens out of Afghanistan “as quickly and safely as possible.”

In the president’s words: “We’re working hard and as fast as we can to get people out. That’s our mission. That’s our goal.”

Biden also says he is also activating the civilian reserve air fleet provided by commercial airlines to help move evacuees from third country waystations on to the United States.

MILAN — Italy’s defense minister has discussed the massive evacuation under way from Kabul in a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, including access to bases in Italy.

Lorenzo Guerini thanked the U.S. military for securing the airport in Kabul, and he exchanged ideas with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on how to “ensure the safe and effective flow of departures from Kabul,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

Guerini said that close ties between the countries was key to helping “assist compatriots and Afghans who have worked with our institutions and organizations.”

The Italian military has flown out of Kabul 2,100 Afghans workers and their families since June, most of those in the last week. Around 1,300 of those have been transferred to Italy.

BERLIN — The World Health Organization and UNICEF are calling for a “humanitarian airbridge” to be set up immediately to allow the unhindered delivery of medicines and other aid supplies to Afghanistan.

The two U.N. agencies said in a statement Sunday that they are “committed to stay and deliver for the people of Afghanistan.”

But they added that “with no commercial aircraft currently permitted to land in Kabul, we have no way to get supplies into the country and to those in need.” They noted that other humanitarian agencies face similar problems.

The agencies said that, even before the Taliban’s recent takeover of Afghanistan, the country required the world’s third-largest humanitarian operation, with more than 18 million people needing help.

They said that while the main focus in recent days has been the evacuation of foreigners and vulnerable Afghans, “the massive humanitarian needs facing the majority of the population should not -- and cannot -- be neglected.”

LONDON -- Britain’s ambassador to Afghanistan says British authorities have managed to evacuate more than 5,000 people, with 1,000 in the last 14 hours alone.

In a statement on Twitter, Laurie Bristow said the “huge effort” to move evacuees out of Afghanistan is “gathering pace” but that there is still “a huge amount of work to do.”

Bristow said he is in the evacuation handling center in Kabul where soldiers, diplomats and forces have been “working around the clock to get our British nationals, Afghan colleagues and Embassy staff to safety.”

In addition to the 4,000 or so U.K. nationals, there are thought to be around 5,000 Afghan allies, such as translators and drivers, who are earmarked for a seat on a British plane.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Bahrain says its national carrier is flying people to the United States as part of efforts to evacuate people from Afghanistan a week after the Taliban takeover.

The U.S.-allied kingdom said Sunday that a Gulf Air flight will transport people from its Isa Air Base to Dulles International Airport south of Washington, DC.

The official statement said the flight was an “affirmation of the Kingdom of Bahrain’s efforts to protect lives.”

Earlier Sunday, the Pentagon activated the initial stage of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, asking for 18 aircraft from American carriers to help transport Americans and Afghans who aided the U.S. war effort.

The commercial airlines will be used to transport people from third countries to their final destinations, allowing the U.S. military to focus on evacuating people from Afghanistan.

PARIS — About 200 people, mostly Afghan nationals, gathered in Paris on Sunday to show solidarity toward evacuees and refugees from Afghanistan, one week after the Taliban took power in the country.

Many were brandishing posters writing “Afghanlivesmatter” and “Evacuation now.”

Safi Matiullah, a 33-year-old Afghan who left his country two years ago and has been living in France for about nine months, said “we want to bring our family here.”

Matiullah said his parents and sisters remained in Afghanistan amid “big danger” and he was not able to get in touch for two weeks.

Ezat, a co-organizer of the gathering who asked not to be identified by his last name, said the Taliban “are taking back all freedoms we had until now and for 20 years.”

He called on France to welcome refugees because “it’s not the Taliban who are fleeing the country, it’s people whose lives are in danger.”

Macron said Monday that France would “do its duty to protect those who are most at risk,” but also said Europeans must “protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows.”

France has evacuated almost 600 people from Kabul since Monday, most of them Afghan citizens who worked with the French government or French groups in Afghanistan.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates— The world’s largest organization of Muslim nations held an extraordinary session in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, with calls for it not to be turned into a hub for terrorism.

The secretary general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Yousef al-Othaimeen, pointed to the escalating humanitarian needs in Afghanistan and noted that “reconciliation is the key to bringing peace.”

The OIC issued a statement after the meeting saying its member states called upon future Afghan leaders and the international community “to ensure that Afghanistan is never used again as a platform or haven for terrorists, and not allow terrorist organizations to have a foothold there.”

The OIC urged Afghan parties to renounce violence, work together and protect and respect the right to life and security in compliance with “tolerant Islamic principles.”

Member states agreed on the need to provide humanitarian assistance in areas that need it most, though no new specific commitments were announced. The meeting also called for dispatching a high-level delegation from the OIC to visit Afghanistan to convey the group’s message of supporting peace and national reconciliation.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will convene a meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday for “urgent talks on the situation in Afghanistan.”

In a statement posted on Twitter, Johnson said it is “vital that the international community works together to ensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people to secure the gains of the last 20 years.”

The U.K. holds this year’s presidency of the G-7 nations, which is also made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The meeting, which will be held virtually, will also address plans to provide humanitarian assistance and support for Afghan refugees.

U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the meeting would seek to help Afghans who aided the war effort and others considered targets under Taliban control of the country.

MOSCOW -- Russia’s president has criticized Western nations for seeking to temporarily house Afghan refugees in Central Asian countries, citing security concerns for Russia.

Speaking at a meeting with top officials of the Kremlin’s United Russia party on Sunday, Vladimir Putin blasted what he described as a “humiliating approach” by Western states.

The Russian president noted that there are no visa restrictions between Russia and its Central Asian allies, and said that Moscow doesn’t “want militants appearing (in Russia) again under the guise of refugees.”

“We don’t want to repeat, even in part, something what we had in the 90s and in the mid-2000s, when there were hostilities in the North Caucasus,” Putin said.

Thousands of people in Afghanistan have been looking for ways to leave the country after the Taliban took control of Kabul in a swift power grab, seeking to escape what they see as a return to ruthless fundamentalist rule. Hundreds have headed to the Central Asian nations of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, which share a border with Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Sunday that it is formally seeking airlift help from commercial airlines to relocate evacuees from Afghanistan once they have gotten out of their country.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has activated the initial stage of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, asking for 18 aircraft: three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and Omni Air; two from Hawaiian Airlines; and four from United Airlines.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the Department does not anticipate a major impact to commercial flights from this activation.

According to Kirby, those aircraft will not fly into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. They will be used to move passengers from way stations once they leave Kabul, allowing the U.S. military to focus on the Afghanistan portion of the evacuation.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The Dutch military is sending extra troops to Kabul to bolster 62 soldiers already in the Afghan capital to help secure evacuation efforts and protect the country’s consular team.

The ministry said Sunday that the extra forces already are on their way to Afghanistan. It did not say how many troops make up the fresh deployment.

A further company of marines and a company of paratroopers also are available for deployment.

Foreign Affairs Minister Sigrid Kaag tweeted earlier Sunday that she had spoken to her British counterpart Dominic Raab about cooperation of the two countries’ military forces in Kabul.

LONDON — Britain’s Ministry of Defense says the country’s armed forces have evacuated nearly 4,000 people from Afghanistan since Aug. 13.

Though it did not provide further details, it’s clear that the majority of those evacuated by British troops are Afghans who have helped Britain over the past 20 years.

In addition to 4,000 or so U.K. citizens, there are thought to be around 5,000 Afghan allies, such as translators and drivers, who are earmarked for a seat on a plane. As of last Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain had managed to get out over 2,000 Afghans and 300 or so U.K. citizens.

“Our Armed Forces continue to work tirelessly at Kabul Airport to ensure the safe evacuation of British nationals and Afghan civilians,” the ministry said in a statement on Twitter.

KYIV, Ukraine -- A Ukrainian military plane evacuated 83 more people out of Kabul on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister.

Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the plane carried 31 Ukrainians back to Kyiv, as well as “foreigners — Afghan women and children, human rights activists, journalists working with Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today.

“They’re safe in Kyiv,” Kuleba said in the tweet. “We don’t abandon our people and help others,” he said, adding that Ukrainian authorities were working on “further evacuations.” Last week, a Ukrainian plane evacuated some 80 people out of Kabul.

Thousands of people in Afghanistan have been looking for ways to leave the country after the Taliban took control of Kabul in a swift power grab, seeking to escape what they see as a return of a ruthless fundamentalist rule.

BERLIN — The U.S. military says an Afghan woman gave birth aboard an Air Force C-17 that flew from the Middle East to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The base is being used as a transit post for people being evacuated from Afghanistan.

The military’s Air Mobility Command tweeted that the mother began having complications during the flight Saturday. It says: “The aircraft commander decided to descend in altitude to increase air pressure in the aircraft, which helped stabilize and save the mother’s life.”

On arrival at Ramstein, U.S. medical personnel came aboard and delivered the child in the aircraft’s cargo bay. “The baby girl and mother were transported to a nearby medical facility and are in good condition,” the military said.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The Dutch government is donating 10 million euros to fund aid such as food, clean drinking water and medical supplies for Afghans.

The foreign ministry said Sunday the money will go to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund that can be tapped by United Nations organizations and NGOs working in Afghanistan.

Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Tom De Bruijn says “we want to support the Afghan population under these difficult circumstances.”

Meanwhile, the Dutch defense ministry said a plane it chartered arrived in the Netherlands on Sunday carrying 160 passengers from Afghanistan. It did not disclose the nationalities of the evacuees.

MADRID — Spain’s government says that U.S. President Joe Biden and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have agreed that the Rota and Morón military bases in Spain used by U.S. forces will temporarily take in Afghans who worked for the Americans and fear Taliban reprisals.

One Spanish plane carrying 64 people who worked for the U.S. landed late Saturday at Spain’s Torrejón air base near Madrid.

Additionally, Spain has received another 230 evacuees this week from Kabul, mostly Afghans who worked for Spain and for the European Union. Fifty-five of these evacuees have already flown on to other EU countries.

LONDON — Tony Blair, the British prime minister who deployed troops to Afghanistan 20 years ago after the 9/11 attacks, says the U.S. decision to leave has “every Jihadist group round the world cheering.”

In a lengthy essay posted on his website late Saturday, Blair said the decision to withdraw troops was “tragic, dangerous, unnecessary.” He added that Britain has a “moral obligation” to stay until “all those who need to be are evacuated.”

He said the exit was not in the West or Afghanistan’s interest, with the Taliban reasserting itself across most of the country.

He also warned that the decision by the U.S. to keep Britain largely in the dark about the withdrawal risks relegating the country to “the second division of global powers.”

Blair accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making the decision on the back of “an imbecilic political slogan about ending ‘the forever wars’.”

KABUL, Afghanistan — The British military says seven Afghan civilians have been killed in the crowds near Kabul’s international airport amid the chaos of those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country.

The Defense Ministry said in a statement Sunday that “conditions on the ground remain extremely challenging but we are doing everything we can to manage the situation as safely and securely as possible.”

The airport has been the focal point for thousands trying to flee the Taliban, who swept into Kabul a week ago after their lightning advance seized the country.

ISLAMABAD — The spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines says the airline has suspended flights from Kabul and is not evacuating anyone at the moment.

Abdullah Hafeez Khan says Sunday that the airline has no on-ground arrangements and lacks appropriate facilities at Kabul international airport to operate evacuation flights.

Khan said the suspension is temporary and the airline will resume its operations once the required arrangements are made there.

NEW DELHI — An Indian official says an air force transport plane has left Kabul for New Delhi carrying 168 people on board.

Arindam Bagchi, the External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, says the plane took off from Kabul on Sunday morning and the passengers include 107 Indian nationals. He didn’t give the nationalities of 61 others evacuated from the Afghan capital.

Meanwhile, another group of 87 Indians who were evacuated from Kabul to Tajikistan on Saturday in an Indian air force plane are being flown to New Delhi on Sunday, Bagchi said in a tweet. Two Nepalese nationals also were evacuated on that flight.

India began evacuating its nationals last Sunday after the Taliban swept into Kabul.

The Press Trust of India news agency said around 400 Indians were believed to be stranded in Afghanistan. No official figure was available.Mark Whelan, a working class kid from Melbourne, fell into banking by accident. It was 1986 on a trip to New York City that his passion for the business was kindled, setting him on a trajectory to become one of Australia’s top executives.

Whelan was head of finance for construction firm Caterpillar at the time and was sent to visit Citibank’s global headquarters. It was here that former prime minister Paul Keating delivered his famous warning that Australia was “done for” if the economy was not reformed.

The “banana republic” speech pushed the Australian dollar to new lows, and Whelan says he was “mobbed” by Citibank traders. “They knew I was an Australian and worked for Caterpillar. And they wanted comment on what I thought would happen.”

Citibank later recruited Whelan, but it was that moment when he “started to fall in love” with financial markets. Now, Whelan has climbed the ranks to lead ANZ’s institutional bank and is widely touted to become the bank’s next chief executive.While touring Las Vegas recently, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi expressed Bangladesh government's willingness to scale up trade with the United States. He was talking to attendees at the Men's Apparel Guild In California (MAGIC), the biggest fashion marketplace in the US, showcasing apparel, footwear and accessories and sourcing resources from all around the world.

The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) of Bangladesh has been patronising local mid-sized apparel manufacturers to participate in this fair for long. That is one laudable but small step in the way of boosting trade between the two countries.

What big steps have we taken to foster the nine-billion-dollar trade further? How Vietnam, with zero export to the US in 1993, has nearly eighty-billion-dollar export earnings? Did we compete intelligently, make smart use of our resources but still fell behind or swayed, carried away and gave up? Could things be done differently?

In the early nineties, Vietnam did not have anything to sell! Instead, it bought from the US. It took the country till 1994 to send the first shipment, whereas we were sitting on $1 billion export and $1.3 billion in total trade that year. Twenty-six years later, Vietnam has registered an 11-fold growth than us in total trade and 13-fold in export only.

Braving the pandemic, Vietnam lifted its trade with the US to $89.63 billion in 2020, covering 2.38 per cent of America's $3.76 trillion total trade volume. With China and Mexico retaining the top two positions, Vietnam made its way to the top 10. We were 46th with $7.92 billion, enjoying a not-so-significant 0.21 per cent market share.

The US Census Bureau has published data till the end of June, and it is apparent that total trade will exceed the $4-trillion mark. Among the top 10 players, China is down two spots, and Vietnam is up two notches!

Bangladesh continues to hold the 46th position with a $4.78 billion trade.

That we need to diversify our export basket is fashionably told by all quarters: government, business, and academia. Perhaps this is one of the rare areas where we have a national consensus!

Indeed, we have diversified. EPB statistics showed that in the fiscal year of 2020-21, our export to the US was $6.97 billion, composed of 68 kinds of products. Only two items – knitwear and woven garments – captured 85.26 per cent of the pie. If we add other textile products to that, it will go past 90 per cent.

In sharp contrast, Vietnam spearheads with cell phone-related equipment, furniture parts, seats (excluding barber and dental), and Portland, aluminous and slag cement. These were bigger than its $12.57-billion apparel export.

Vietnam carefully crafted its exportable for the US. We probably developed such market research neither at the public nor at the private level. The top five US imports consistently have been oil, passenger vehicles, computers, cell phone equipment, and medicines in individual dosages for many years. Vietnam struck two of them very well.

Back home, the recent focus on leather and non-leather shoes by both producers and regulators is visible. Our mainstream media emphatically covered that footwear export to the US from Bangladesh posted a 73.13 per cent growth in the fiscal year of 2020-21 to reach $230.2 million, up from $132.96 million in FY20.

Alongside, we can also put together all our power behind furniture, insulated wire, toys, children's bicycles, refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning machines - all on America's rising demand list.

After a series of talks between the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the US Chamber of Commerce, a US Bangladesh Business Council was launched in Washington on April 6, 2021. During the launch, it was said the council would serve as a platform for American businesses to engage both governments to promote opportunities for businesses to drive mutually beneficial economic growth.

We would like to view this as a big leap forward. Heavyweights like Chevron, GE, Visa, MetLife, or Facebook are sitting on the board of the USBBC.

One can also keenly see the developments in May through July. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, the four American tech giants, obtained Business Identification Number (BIN) as nonresidents and have started submitting VAT returns.

With $754 million in trade in June, Bangladesh has made its way to the top five of the US's "Fastest Growing Top 50 Trade Partners". One might argue that these rankings vary widely from month to month. But registering a spot in the top five out of 212 countries and territories with an astounding 82.43 per cent rise is worth cherishing.

This suggests that total trade will hit $10 billion this year. But, that is an altitude we are scaling after 50 years of independence with over 100 million working people.

It is time we changed our habits a bit! Let us not concentrate only on the cash cow RMG rather eye on other products that the US has a lasting need for. This will require policy and monetary support and adjustments in physical and financial infrastructure. Let us do it!

We might have lost the battle, but we can still win the war!

Guedes spoke to investors as the country's political climate became even more tense after far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's request to the Senate on Friday to impeach a Supreme Court judge.

Critics have accused Bolsonaro of sowing doubts about Brazil's voting system so he can question next year's election results if he loses.

The political clashes are worsening, Guedes said.

"There is much political noise - it is understandable, but it has to be reduced," Guedes said.

Guedes also said the budget deficit would drop to 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2022, compared to 1.7 per cent this year. Earlier, Special Treasury and Budget Secretary Bruno Funchal, speaking on the legal news website Jota, said there was room to revise down the 2022 primary budget deficit, currently targeted at 170 billion reais.

Brazil can expect to see a budget surplus in 2023 as the economy begins to grow again, recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, Funchal said.

But Funchal said fiscal uncertainty has been causing market turbulence in the past few weeks, with the real currency weakening against the dollar, as investors worry about the public debt and court-ordered payments the government owes.

Funchal said any increase in these liabilities is now the main challenge facing the Treasury, one that will hurt spending on social welfare programs and other government policies if it is not dealt with. The 2022 budget that the Economy Ministry will send Congress will include the payment of 89 billion reais ($16.57 billion) in court-ordered obligations, and discretionary spending will have to be reduced to allow for that, Funchal said.The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said on Friday its annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, will take place on August 27 virtually and not in person as planned, the clearest sign yet of the impact of the Covid-19 Delta variant on the Fed's plans.

"While we are disappointed that health conditions will prevent us from being able to gather in person at the Jackson Lake Lodge this year as we had planned, the safety of our guests and the Teton County community is our priority," said Kansas City Fed President Esther George in a statement, citing the recently elevated Covid-19 health risk level in Teton County.

Under the county's guidelines, people should not gather with non-family members or host in-person social activities.

The reversal raises questions about the Fed's broader assessment of the Delta variant's economic impact, which Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have mostly played down, saying that businesses and households have learned to live with the virus. "It certainly is going to be a communications challenge" for Powell to stick to the view of only minor impact from the recent surge when he'll be giving his highly anticipated speech on the economic outlook to an online-only audience," said Yale School of Management's Steven Kelly.

Or, as Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk quipped on Twitter, "I think the tenor of @federalreserve Powell's comments just shifted a bit on the economic outlook." At their meeting last week, Fed policymakers began coalescing around a plan to begin to reduce their support for the economy before the end of the year, as long as the labor market continued to improve as expected.

The Delta variant, however, is raising questions around that.

Earlier on Friday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who backs a plan to start trimming the Fed's economy-bolstering bond purchases by October, said he was already seeing some signs of the rising caseloads' impact on hiring and would be watching it carefully in the run-up to the Fed's next meeting, in September.

The gathering was already going to be a muted affair. The guest list had been scaled back, with foreign central bankers not attending, many of the lodge facilities closed or limited, and masks mandatory outside of meals.

Vaccines were required for all attendees and their families.

Even as late as Friday afternoon Fed policymakers had still been planning to attend, with their staffs pinning down details for meetings outside of the scheduled events.

The Fed said this week, however, that Powell would give his marquee speech remotely. And now everyone else will attend online as well.

Sparsely populated Wyoming on a per capita basis has averaged 54 cases per 100,000 people in the last week versus 43 per 100,000 for the country as a whole. Teton County's rate is 62 per 100,000.Confusion reigns for businesses trying to get to grips with mandatory scanning and record-keeping for "busy places and large gatherings".

The government announced yesterday that mandatory sign-ins were being introduced to ensure the government could contact trace quickly.

Among the list provided by the Health Ministry were obvious super-spreader culprits like casinos and concerts but conspicuous in their absence were large retail outfits which would include Mitre 10, Bunnings, K-Mart and The Warehouse, malls and supermarkets.

The prospect of mandating record-keeping has been on the cards since June, around the time an infected traveller from Sydney came to Wellington and visited a number of eateries and tourist attractions, however miraculously did not infect anyone.

The announcement was due to happen last week, but was delayed due to the current outbreak.

Business NZ chief executive Kirk Hope said it was not exactly clear which companies would have to comply.

"I'm sure the officials have worked through the detail but it needs to be more clearly communicated to the businesses that it's going to affect.

"They've said events and hospitality venues and so on, but I think there certainly needs to be more clarity around who's going to be required to report from a mandatory perspective... There are penalties if you fail to comply so if you're a business and you don't know whether you're covered or not, that's not going to be particularly helpful."

Businesses that failed to keep contact tracing records in line with what the government currently had in place under the Covid-19 Response Act, could be fined between $300 to $1000.

Hope said businesses were already dealing with defiant customers over other government regulations, such as mask wearing, and this could make it worse.

"Businesses have to do this. It's not their choice. So the message is for the public to go easy on people and we've already seen some instances of aggression by people choosing not to wear masks.

"We don't want to see any more of that sort of stuff."

Countdown and Foodstuffs supermarkets were initially both unclear whether the order applied to them, until the government clarified advice later on Sunday evening, which ruled them out.

"A mandatory record keeping requirement for the retail sector was considered, but ultimately we agreed that the compliance burden for small businesses would be too onerous. We do encourage all businesses to promote use of QR codes and record keeping as much as possible," Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said.

He confirmed the requirement would only be for places mask wearing wasn't practical and where people gathered in large numbers.

Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said while this by and large ruled out the entire retail sector, grey areas remained.

"There's certainly a number of businesses where it will be a little bit grey. Those with cafes inside them are a really good example. I think the rules will certainly be applying to the cafe part of that business whereas that may not apply to the store in general."

Customer aggression toward employees had increased over the past 12 to 18 months and it was not fair they should be the ones to enforce sign-ins, he said.

"The enforcement of this should be sitting with the police rather than with the businesses."

Cafe's, bars and restaurants were specifically named as places that have to oblige.

Tony Crosbie runs 14 venues across the South Island and said patrons who refused would simply be turned away, but he did not expect push-back based on last time there was a push on record keeping.

"What I found with the customers is they actually respected it because they knew we were trying to keep them safe. And of course, at the table, we had the sanitising and all the equipment that we needed for them to make them feel safe in the venue as well."

"If it means that we can get our businesses back open, well then I think that's an easy ask."

So long as that was the extent of the compulsory orders, hospitality businesses would be onboard, he said.

"There's whispers around people having to wear masks inside hospitality venues and that'll be an absolute disaster.

"People aren't going to sit around a table with their mates and wear masks. It's just not practical. So we're 100 percent behind the tracing, but absolutely not with a mask... if it's a matter of compulsory masks then leave us locked up."

Customers or people working in customer facing roles at an essential service such as a pharmacy, supermarket or petrol station must wear a face covering.

Likewise, they are legally required on public transport and flights.

Mandatory record keeping would come into effect seven days after an alert level change, to give businesses that were re-opening time to prepare.

Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said it was not clear how the mandatory record keeping would be enforced or how businesses would keep the information secure.

Edwards told Morning Report most of the requests made of New Zealanders have been based on a strong link with the fight against the pandemic.

"With this proposal ... that evidence base is not that clear about the advantages of mandating businesses keeping records over public campaigns promoting that."

It was not clear how the measure would be enforced and there were no details on host venues' responsibility if someone appeared to be scanning in did not not, or wrote down false contact information.

It was also unclear how businesses would keep information in registers secure and ensure it is used only for public health purposes.

"If we see these open registers sitting on counters and bars so you can see everybody else's email and phone number, that's going to put some people off."

There should be a specific statutory limitation on what the information can be used for, he said. For example the contact details should not immediately go into the business's mailing list.CHARLESTOWN, R.I. (AP) — The latest developments on Tropical Storm Henri and its impacts on …The villas will come up on plots ranging from 12 cottah to 2 bigha land and priced between Rs 3 crore and Rs 6 crore

The venture is coming up on the Basanti highway, 16 kilometres off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass on a 55-acre land. The project will also have luxury villas along with the wellness resort. The first phase will be launched later this year with the 30-key resort and 20 villas, Sushil Mohta, a director and one of the consortium partners of South City, informed.

South City Group, a consortium of six Calcutta-based developers, is foraying into the hospitality sector with a luxury wellness resort focusing on ayurveda.

“We will invest about Rs 100 crore in the hospitality segment. The residential villa section will be crucial to make it viable as there is hardly any payback for such a hospitality venture,” Mohta explained.

The villas will come up on plots ranging from 12 cottah to 2 bigha land and priced between Rs 3 crore and Rs 6 crore.There are about 100 villas planned for the second phase.

In the wellness venture, South City Group has tied up with the Carnoustie group which operates such a facility near Kochi in Kerala. South City’s wellness resort is spread over 40,000 square feet.

The South City Ayurveda and Wellness Retreat plans to offer diverse treatment and wellness packages of one to three weeks. Those who enrol for the package will stay in the resort. Rack rate for the rooms is likely to be Rs 10,000 a night.

“Wellness is a booming industry, especially after the pandemic. There are many such boutiques in Kerala and a few more have come up near the Himalayas. However, there is none in this part of the country, especially in Bengal. This centre can fill up the gap,” Mohta explained.

The developers are expecting half of the traffic to be generated from the city itself as many from this part of the country travel to the wellness centres in Kerala and Dehradun.The Latest: Protesters still marching in France against passThere has been a case of fire in Washington, evacuations have been ordered when we talk about downtown Puyallup which was due to the 3 alarm commercial fire which was at a cold storage facility and this took place on Saturday in the morning. the responders are pretty concerned about the toxic fumes and also about the risk of fire which can cause a large explosion, it has been stated by the Central pierce fire, there are hundreds of firefighters who have responded to the situation in Washington.

The eventual choice may devastate a company, or create enormous value. After such a search, it is usually assumed that the winning candidate knows what a CEO does, particularly since the winner is often already a CEO.

In his landmark Harvard Business Review article “The Secrets of Great CEO Selection” Ram Charan shared four key “secrets” for great CEO selection. First, the selectors “select two or three capabilities required for the new leader to succeed in that firm.” Second, they strive for objectivity as they review candidates. Third, they choose “not the best leader but the best fit.” Finally, they “allow for the imperfections in the chosen candidate.”

What’s missing from the list of key steps is an agreed description of the job that the CEO will actually do. Now, you might think, after particularly after a grueling search process, that surely everyone knows what a CEO does.

Yet at a time of transition the industrial era to the digital age, two very different conceptions of what a CEO does are afoot.

Two Different Concepts Of What A CEO Does

Let’s take the CEOs of the three most valuable firms today, all of them digital, and each worth more than $2 trillion: Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. In an earlier article, I noted how CEO Satya Nadella at Microsoft acts very differently from his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Elsewhere, I wrote how Jeff Bezos at Amazon acted very differently from the typical CEO. Similarly, Apple CEO Tim Cook says he doesn’t, like most CEOs, focus on stock price. “The stock price and revenues and profits are a result of doing things right on the innovation side, on the creativity side, focusing on the right products, treating customers like jewels, and focusing on the user experience. And so that's what we put our energies.”

What typical CEOs do is very different from this behavior. We know this from a Harvard Business School survey conducted by two management icons, Michael Porter and Nitin Nohria who comprehensively examined the CEO time-use in large, complex companies over an extended period. It tracked the time allocation of 27 CEOs—nearly 60,000 CEO hours.

The jobs performed by the digital CEOs and those of the industrial-era CEOs, both have the same label, “CEO”. But what they do is as different as day and night.

a. The startling contrast between the behavior of a digital-age CEO versus CEOs of the industrial era begins with the goal of the firm. The digital CEO has a customer-first mindset. By contrast, the HBS survey shows that for industrial-era CEOs, customers are almost an afterthought. The CEOs spend only 3% of their time on customers—a fact of which they themselves had been unaware. “Most of the CEOs were dismayed to discover how little time they spent with their customers,” the survey notes.

b. The digital CEO’s main task is the road map for the future. Thus, for Bezos, it was ‘pretty much all’ that he worked on, delegating the day-to-day business operations to others.” His job was all about long-term thinking. A very different picture of industrial-era CEOs emerges from the HBS CEO survey: the word, “innovation,” is not used even once in the HBS survey of what CEOs do, Instead, these CEOs are preoccupied with administering current business operations. The CEOs have “vast, encompassing functional agendas, business unit agendas, multiple organizational levels, and myriad external issues… Unlike any other executive, the CEO has to engage with them all.”

The frequent defense of CEOs that this failure to address innovation is the fault of pressure from the stock market to achieve quarterly profit targets is undermined by the lofty valuations accorded to the digital giants that do focus on the future.

c. The third dimension is the continuous creation of new businesses. A constant Bezos maxim, for example, is that “We're still at ‘day one’ of the internet.” In effect, in Bezos’s eyes, “Amazon is just getting started,” Bezos repeatedly led Amazon into new businesses on a massive scale. A very different picture of the CEOs emerges from the HBS survey. These CEOs seem to be living in a pre-digital world, with no indication of any interest in the creation of new businesses. That is partly because they have a “grueling schedule” administering the existing business. “Why such a grueling schedule? Because it is essential to the role,” explain Porter and Nohria. “Every constituency associated with a company wants direct contact with the person at the top.”

d. The digital CEO creates multiple paths to yes. For Bezos, “the most important word at Amazon is yes." Bezos explains that "in a traditional corporate hierarchy… a junior executive comes up with a new idea that they want to try. They have to convince their boss, their boss's boss, their boss's boss and so on—any 'no' in that chain can kill the whole idea.”

Here again, a radically different picture emerges in the HBS survey of industrial-era CEOs. There is no hint of any effort to create “multiple paths to yes.” According to the survey, these CEOs are preoccupied with such internal issues as to whether “spending insufficient time with colleagues will make them appear insular and out of touch.” In effect, these CEOs are playing the role of CEO, rather than being the CEO.

e. The fifth aspect of the digital CEO is to be ‘the Chief Slowdown Officer’ for big bets. In Amazon, there are "many paths to yes" for small improvements. But when it came to larger ideas that could change the direction of the whole company, Bezos saw himself as acting as "chief slowdown officer." Here again, a radically different picture emerges with the CEOs in the HBS survey. There is no hint of any business creation playbook for major changes in the firm’s direction. Instead, the CEOs seem so busy administering the existing business and meeting the short-term profit targets, they have little time to think about such matters.

How To Solve The Problem Of Failing ‘Digital Transformations’

The overall picture is thus one of stark contrasts. A digital CEO is an entrepreneur with a passion for creating new value for customers and a preoccupation with strategic agility. Industrial-era CEOs act as cautious administrators, overseeing the existing business, preoccupied with satisfying the multiple constituencies that have claims on their time.

Many industrial-era firms are attempting “digital transformation” yet having little success. A key aspect of the problem is simple: the CEOs of these firms are not acting like digital-era CEOs.

Boards have an easy remedial action at hand: create—and monitor—a digital-age CEO job description.

The Seven Things A Highly Agile CEO DoesCanberra small hot-water businesses have warned they are in danger of financial collapse due to them not being able to participate in the territory government's energy efficiency improvement scheme. General manager of Harvest Hot Water Erik Olbrei said many small businesses in the industry were not eligible to participate in the scheme by offering rebates to customers looking to install more efficient hot water heat pumps in their homes. He said the smaller players in the industry were at risk of being priced out by the larger competitors who were part of the government scheme offering extra financial incentives. "We have been going on for about five years, just limping along, and for the firms that don't get the rebates, it's hard to compete," Mr Olbrei said. "Closing is what I'm looking at right now, basically putting the business in mothballs because at the moment it is just not viable. "What I'm calling for is for the scheme to be opened up to all of the firms in the ACT." Mr Olbrei said he had tried several times to get his business to be able to participate in the government scheme, without success. Under the scheme, which was set up in the ACT in 2013, Canberrans are able to access rebates to switch over to more energy-efficient appliances, such as hot water heat pumps. Government figures have shown hot water is the second biggest energy user in Canberra homes, with heat pumps using up to 80 per cent less energy than standard hot-water systems. Since the introduction of the scheme, more than 45 per cent of ACT homes have taken part, saving on average $5.80 per week. The scheme had a large review in 2018, which found it was effective in reaching a large amount of ACT households. While Mr Olbrei said the scheme was good in getting Canberra homes to produce less carbon emissions, it favoured larger players in the industry. "If we had access to the full lot of rebates, the prices for the hot water heat pump models could also be driven down," he said. "That way, the market could work to drive down prices and make a hot water heat pump replacement more appealing and also have better value." It's a similar situation being felt by Pure Electric, which also sells hot water heat pumps to customers, but is not eligible to offer rebates to customers. "It's a really badly thought out and badly implemented scheme," its director Matthew Wright said. "It favours only a couple of providers that have the monopoly in the industry, unlike similar schemes in other states which are open to more players. "It's still a very closed sort of thing." ACT Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Shane Rattenbury said the choice of installers under the scheme was a commercial decision by ActewAGL. "The Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission undertakes independent analysis of ActewAGL's processes in undertaking [the scheme's] activities," Mr Rattenbury said. "The performance of the scheme is regularly evaluated. "As a tier one regulated retailer under the scheme, ActewAGL is obligated to undertake energy saving activities in households and small-medium businesses. The rebates and discounts offered to customers are a commercial decision by ActewAGL." Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

Fnatic has qualified for the World Championships every year since 2016. This is the first time in G2’s history that they won’t appear at Worlds (since they began in European LoL in 2016).

G2 took game one with excellent team fighting and good execution after what started as a close match. Fnatic then levelled the series at 1-1 before G2 responded and took game three, despite Fnatic’s dominance through most of the game. Fnatic then won games four and five, to the delight of Fnatic fans across Europe.

G2 has been one of the world’s best teams for several years, reaching two Worlds semi-finals and one final in the last three years. At the beginning of the season, Fnatic legend Carl Martin Eric ‘Rekkles’ Larsson moved to G2 to replace Luka ‘Perkz’ Perkovic as the team’s ADC.

G2’s star mid-laner Rasmus ‘Caps’ Winther also left Fnatic to join G2 back in 2018.

Fnatic Founder and CEO Sam Mathews was buzzing with the win, and appeared to throw shade at G2:

Fnatic — an org headquartered in London — were forced to make a losers-bracket run to Worlds qualification after only placing fifth in the regular season.

The Twin Cities branch, 3430 University Ave. SE in Minneapolis, will be the 51-year-old enterprise’s first outside of its home state of Michigan. This location is a former bank branch that Wells Fargo has donated to Project for Pride in Living (PPL), which is working with First Independence Bank on its expansion into the market.

“We are fortunate to find a site on a major thoroughfare, making it accessible to the large cross-section of residents and businesses that a bank needs to be economically viable,” First Independence Bank chairman and CEO Kenneth Kelly said.“Being on a light rail line and a bus route is a plus for the under-resourced communities we hope to serve, particularly the Black community. So is the opportunity to be part of an established commercial area with few nearby banking options.” He added that the site also has a drive-through for added convenience, and space to host education sessions and community gatherings.

The branch is expected to open early November. A second location at Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue is possible in the future, said Kelly.

Damon Jenkins, formerly Wells Fargo’s district manager for Minneapolis, has joined First Independence Bank as senior vice president and Twin Cities regional market president.

Five banks in the Twin Cities — Bank of America, Bremer Bank, Huntington Bank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo — are each supporting First Independence Bank’s arrival with capital, research, marketing and other services to assure its start-up and long-term success.

“We are thrilled to be working with these five banks to open a branch in the region,” Kelly said. “Banks are beacons of hope in their communities, and we intend to be that for the people of Minneapolis, St. Paul and the rest of the Twin Cities, particularly those who are unbanked or underbanked throughout the region.”

Kelly said First Independence Bank’s decision to open in the Twin Cities came easily after discussions that began in April with several Black business, religious, nonprofit and other community leaders in the region.

“Since First Independence Bank prioritizes services to the Black community and under-resourced businesses and individuals, it was important to me to listen to these leaders about what the community needs and how the bank could make a difference. They welcomed me generously and offered important guidance,” said Kelly. As a result, housing will be a major focus for First Independence Bank in the Twin Cities. “Our innovative home loan programs will help reduce one of the largest disparities in the country between Black and white homeowners.” The branch also will offer customers ATM and debit card use at any Huntington and Wells Fargo ATM location with no ATM service fee, a loan program to help establish a credit score or repair personal credit, virtual financial education sessions, and more.

“Each of our companies has doubled down on investments in racial equity within our own organizations and the communities we serve over the past year,” said Tim Welsh, vice chair, U.S. Bank consumer and business banking. “The events of that year also showed us the value of thinking and acting differently. So, we asked ourselves what could we do, working together, beyond what we were doing on our own? Helping to support an established, Black-owned bank’s expansion into this region rose to the top of the list.”

Helping to bring a competitor into the market might seem counterintuitive, Laurie Nordquist, Wells Fargo’s Central lead region president, observed. “But for the five of us, the case is clear. Black households are more than five times more likely than white households to be unbanked. We need to continue our efforts for outreach and inclusion while also supporting a Black-owned bank. This is not an ‘either-or’ proposition—it’s a ‘both-and’ proposition. Supporting a bank like First Independence Bank, with its history and know-how, is part of the change we are collectively working to make in the financial services ecosystem.”

Jeanne Crain, president and CEO of Bremer Financial, added that, as a qualified Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), First Independence Bank is able to tap into a special CDFI Fund that allows for more favorable lending rates to individuals and businesses in low-income areas. And, although Black-owned businesses exist in many industry sectors in the Twin Cities, the region lacks an established, Black-owned bank. “That’s a gap that First Independence Bank is uniquely able to help fill,” Crain said.

First Independence Bank is the 7th largest Black-owned commercial bank in the United States. It offers a variety of high-quality banking services from managing accounts to personal loans, mortgages, consumer education and investments. First Independence bank has three locations and offers banking solutions online and digitally through its mobile app. Established in 1970, the bank continues to be a responsible leader, efficiently serving the financial needs of its community, its businesses and its customers nationwide. First Independence Bank is a member of FDIC and Equal Housing Lender.The number of homes selling for huge sums over list price has risen rapidly since the start of the year – and San Diego is part of the trend.

A recent Zillow.com analysis found that nationally, in the second quarter, 2,244 houses sold for $500,000 or more over their original list price. That’s more than twice the number in the first quarter of 2021.

Those selling for $1 million over list were up 60% over the prior quarter. The share that sold for 30% or more over list rose from 1.1% to 1.7%.
• Six houses sold for $1 million or more over the initial list price, compared to four in the first quarter;
• 31 houses sold for $500,000 or more over the original list price, compared to 16 in the first quarter, and
• 0.8% of homes sold for 30% or more above the first list price, compared to 0.5% in the first quarter.

San Francisco leads the 50 largest U.S. metros in the share of homes sold for 30% over their list price or higher at 7.5%.

Buffalo, NY, where 6.7% of homes sold for more than 30% over list, follows, then Austin at 5.5%.

California topped the list of markets with the most homes sold for half a million or more over the asking price in the second quarter.

San Francisco far outpaced other markets with 664, followed by San Jose, with 296, and Los Angeles, at 136.

Seattle and Miami, tied at 102, came next.

“Our markets have seen an explosion in growth since early 2020,” said Jake Melendez, chief data officer at Active Realty. “Many of our sellers are seeing over 60% of a return on their investment from purchases just several years ago, while our buyers are locking in lower interest rates than we’ve seen in decades.”New Delhi: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has developed an AI-enabled chatbot, Urja - the first in the country's oil and gas industry - to provide its customers an interface for a seamless self-service experience and faster resolution of queries/issues.

The chatbot is "an intelligent virtual assistant with AI/NLP (Natural Language Processing) capabilities and trained on more than 600 use cases," the company said in a statement.

The virtual assistant offers services such as LPG booking, price and payment status, and delivery status of booked LPG cylinder and refill history.

It also allows users to change LPG distributor, update mobile number, request services from BharatGas distributors like mechanic services, and seek double bottle connection (for single bottle connection customers). It helps locate the nearest petrol pump as well as provides the price of petrol and diesel. It can also be used for seeking doorstep delivery of fuel. With the objective of making BPCL's customer interface comprehensive and integrated digitally, Urja is now available on the company website for any queries for both B2B and B2C.

"The virtual assistant is designed to deliver a seamless self-service experience and enable faster resolution of consumer queries/issues," it said.

BPCL said it has initiated 'Project Anubhav' with an objective of delivering to its vast retail (B2C) and commercial (B2B) customer base a consistent superior and unified experience across multiple touchpoints. "Under Project Anubhav, Urja represents an integrated communication platform that connects all BPCL communication to any channel, unifying all customer touch points with a single and cohesive voice," it said.Lucknow: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of the economy, and the Narendra Modi government has given the sector its rightful place.

Addressing the launch of the 'Ubharte Sitaare Fund' here, Sitharaman said, "The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a proper identity to MSME. The place, which it had not got in decades, is being given to it, and it will be improved." "In the last two years, the Centre has done a number of different things. The government has changed the definition of MSME in a very flexible manner. Recently, a bill was tabled in the Parliament through which the MSME sector will directly benefit," she added.

Sitharaman further said MSME businessmen will not have to undertake an audit for submission of their accounts. "The government has faith in them, and they can self-attest their accounts and certify them," she said.

Speaking about the geographical indication (GI) tags for specialised products, she said while they are scattered across the country, in Uttar Pradesh, Banaras and its immediate surroundings alone boast of eight GIs.

Sitharaman urged the state's MSME Minister Sidharth Nath Singh to establish an MSME chamber in every district, and hold awareness programmes about the 'Ubharte Sitaare Fund' so that entrepreneurs working under the One District, One Product (ODOP) scheme can know about its benefits.

Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of MSMEs and has effectively implemented the One District One Product programme, which provides the ideal ecosystem for success of an initiative like the Ubharte Sitaare Fund. The fund will go a long way in making India a major exporting hub, she said.

Meanwhile, a tweet by Sitharaman's office said MSMEs have been at the forefront of the Modi government's economic policy through policies like change in definition of MSMEs to ensure adequate flexibility, effective implementation of ECLGS and Factoring Bill increasing the number of designated NBFCs to 9,000.

The 'Ubharte Sitaare Fund' has been set up by Exim Bank and SIDBI.

The fund is expected to identify Indian enterprises with potential advantages by way of technology, products or processes along with export potential, but which are currently underperforming or unable to tap their latent potential to grow.

Harsha Bangari, Deputy Managing Director, India Exim Bank, said the bank has developed a robust pipeline of over 100 potential proposals and supported several companies across a diverse range of sectors.Requiring young, healthy staff to be double jabbed before they are allowed to return to the office is unnecessary, the former head of the vaccine taskforce said in a rejection of “jabs for jobs” policies.

Clive Dix, who stepped back from his role as interim chairman of the taskforce in April, said companies should understand what double vaccination actually means for their staff.

He said: “If people are young and they get double vaccinated, they’ll probably get slightly less illness than if they’re single-dosed, but most of them will be fine either way. Vaccination doesn’t actually completely stop transmission. It just slows it down a bit.”New Delhi: After the initial public offering (IPO) of LIC, about 60 per cent of the insurance business will be with listed companies, Additional Secretary in the Finance Ministry Amit Agarwal said on Saturday.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had in July given its in-principle approval for the listing of insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

The IPO of the state-owned life insurer is part of the government's efforts to raise Rs 1.75 lakh crore through disinvestment in the current financial year.

Speaking at an event to mark Actuaries Day, Agrawal said amid global challenges, India has continued to develop as an emerging economy with a financial system that has matured, deepened and achieved scale. The needs of this emerging India are in many ways different, he said, adding the insurance sector, over the two decades since the introduction of competition and regulation, has matured with 69 insurers today as against only eight in 2000.

"A majority of these have crossed their initial breakeven phase. Once the proposed listing of LIC happens, about 60 per cent of the insurance industry business would be with listed entities. The sector as a whole has been growing at a pace significantly higher than that of the overall economy," he said.

Currently, there are four listed life insurers, and two in the non-life segment. State-owned re-insurer General Insurance Corporation of India is also listed on bourses.Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

Hey friends! This week was more than hectic, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Below are more notes on the Brazilian IPO market, more coverage of the Chicago startup scene and a host of numbers from startups concerning their recent growth results. So, if you like early-stage or later-stage startups, international startups or domestic startups, we have just what you want!

Another week, another Twitter conversation about funding rounds. To catch you up, this week saw more folks complaining about the media covering funding rounds over other examples of startup activity. My contention for years has been that we, the scribbling classes, cover funding rounds because they are the rare moment that startups are willing to actually share results of their operations.

That VCs will occasionally complain about this is particularly rich, given that investors would hardly be willing to invest in a company based on a short call with a founder about how they came up with an idea. And yet they tell founders to not tell the media anything at all. Alas.

Regardless, all this shook out to me saying, "Hey startups, send in your data!" And some folks did! Others sent in notes about stuff that they had announced before, but that we’d missed.

So here’s a digest of startup growth from a number of stages, markets and the like:

CopyAI: The company recently crossed the $2 million ARR threshold. CopyAI is busy building its business in public, which we love, sharing metrics as it goes. And it has raised external capital and grown rapidly while doing so, providing a proof point that you can share information and not have your startup instantly burst into flames.

I asked CEO Paul Yacoubian if growth has kept up with his expectations, and he said that it has. Our next question: How long until the company can double in size yet again? CopyAI reached $1 million ARR earlier this year.

TextNow: Now over the $100 million ARR mark. The company, essentially bootstrapped after raising less than $2 million during its life, also recently hired a CFO. You know what that means -- an IPO is coming. Frankly TextNow is not a company I know well, but thanks to it sharing information, I now want to learn more about it. See!

Kalendar AI: This company helps folks book sales meetings using AI, it appears. And the model is showing some traction, according to founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu. He shared a host of metrics with The Exchange, including its bank balance and growth charts. (Hell yeah, data!) The company is generating ARR in the six figures and raised $700,000 in a recent round.

And per its charts, subscriber signups appear to be accelerating. Per a different dataset shared, August is going to be the company’s busiest month yet when it comes to meetings booked, the key non-GAAP metric for its business. That figure is growing at 30% monthly, the startup said.

In Vadrevu’s own phrasing, Kalendar AI wants to “democratize growth for companies like how AWS democratized innovation with virtualization.”

Balto: Balto is a St. Louis-based startup that has raised just over $50 million. The company reached out with some neat data from its recent round, a $37.5 million Series B. Per the company’s COO Chris Kontes, “Jump Capital, OCA Ventures and Sandalphon” took part in the round. Which matters if you read our recent dig into the Chicago market.

Regardless, Balto said that it grew its customer base by 84% and its revenue by 200% since it raised its Series A in Q3 2020. I asked if the ∆ between the company’s customer and revenue growth was driven by net dollar retention (NDR) or larger customers. Per Kontes, “the answer is a bit of both” with a bias toward NDR. He didn’t share an absolute number, but did say that Balto’s “NDR is north of 150%.” Hot dang.

The company, by the by, built tech to help support agents know what to say during calls. Which, it appears, is big business.

HostiFi: Headquartered near Detroit, HostiFi helps customers “remotely monitor and manage UniFi Network devices.” I do not know what that means, sadly, and don’t have the minutes right now to dig in more deeply.

But in better news, HostiFi’s founder Reilly Chase dropped a grip of metrics into our inbox. His company will reach $1 million in ARR in the “next few weeks,” and wants to hit $10 million ARR in “the next 3 years,” which we dig. The company raised $100,000 from what was previously known as Earnest Capital, a group that we’ve covered. HostiFi has 1,700 customers, it says, and a fully remote team of six.

Fun, yeah? Private companies being more open with their financial performance is good for the world as the activity has a way of making the opaque startup world just a bit more limpid.

Our dive into the Brazilian startup market and its impending IPOs was good fun to write. But as we went to press, Brazil’s B3 stock exchange got back to our questions with answers. They just missed our timeline, but we’d be remiss to not share some of their notes here.

Regarding the present state of the Brazilian technology IPO market, B3’s Rafaela Vesterman Araujo wrote the following (minor edits for clarity):

This is precisely the trend that we were trying to highlight, and note, so it’s nice to see the data back us up.

Next up, how big does a company have to be to list on B3? Here’s Vesterman Araujo (minor edits for clarity):

Hello, growth premium! That’s great news for local Brazilian startups hoping to get public in their home market. With Nubank and Nuvemshop growing huge while private, where the country’s companies will go public is no small matter.

We dug into the Chicago boom this week, tracking the Windy City’s huge venture capital results from the past few quarters and asking locals precisely what was driving the wave of funding and startup activity. As we got that into WordPress, another set of answers came in that we want you to read.

Techstars’ Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of its Chicago operations, had this to say about why Chicagoland startups have excelled in attracting capital since late 2020:

I went to school in Chicago, so am pretty aware of the density of schools in the area. I was curious if that fact was beneficial to local startups. Per Sáles-Griffin, the answer is a hard yes:

Where should we look for the next generation of startups from Chicago? The Techstars denizen listed healthcare and life sciences as a key market, as well as food tech and companies building in the larger transit space.

So many other things!

Sadly, we are way over our word count for this newsletter, so we have to stop. But lots of other things out there are worth your attention. Like Indianapolis-based Lessonly being acquired by Seismic. Lessonly had raised just under $30 million while operating on its own, helmed by the dynamo-like Max Yoder. And Aspiration Partners -- backed by a number of well-known actors -- is going public via a SPAC. The deal will provide hundreds of millions in fresh capital to the company.Each week The Pantagraph profiles a different community member. Know someone we should talk to?

It's always an exciting time when the school year starts back up. We look forward to seeing familiar faces and friends again.

Usually we bulk up inventory and staff to prepare, but this year has had its challenges in both departments. I have an amazing staff that has been filling in a lot of gaps as we get busier, and fabulous vendors that have helped us with inventory that we need.

As business picks up this time of year they have all stepped up to help us prepare.

As for how the crowd goes, after a three-month gap you never really know what to expect, different trends and new items, you never really know what to have as far as what the hot new item is, but we always have something that they like. Some years students come out early, sometimes they come out late, sometimes Tuesdays, sometimes Thursdays, you never know quite what to expect, so we try to be prepared every day.New Delhi: Capital markets regulator Sebi has kept the proposed Rs 4,500-crore initial share-sale of edible oil major Adani Wilmar Ltd (AWL) in "abeyance".



However, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) did not clarify further.

The company had filed preliminary papers with Sebi on August 3, to raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO).

Without disclosing the reason, Sebi said "issuance of observations kept in abeyance" with regard to the Adani Wilmar IPO, according to an update in the SEBI website as on August 13.

In market parlance, observations of Sebi is a kind of go-ahead to float a public issue.

In a statement on Saturday, Adani Group spokesperson said, "we have not received any formal communication from Sebi with respect to the IPO observations being kept in abeyance".

"While we have always been fully compliant with applicable Sebi Regulations, we have made full disclosure to Sebi on specific information requests from them in the past. We will continue to cooperate with the regulators in the future as well," the spokesperson added.

The proposed listing of AWL on the stock exchanges will comprise an IPO in the form of fresh issue of new equity shares by AWL for an amount of up to Rs 4,500 crore (approximately USD 600 million).

There will not be any secondary offering, Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), the flagship firm of Adani group, had said in a regulatory filing.

The company, which sells cooking oils under the Fortune brand, is a major player in the edible oil industry.

Proceeds from the IPO are proposed to be used by AWL to fund capital expenditure for expansion of existing manufacturing facilities. The funds will also be utilised for developing new manufacturing facilities, repayment/ prepayment of borrowings, to fund strategic acquisitions and investments, and general corporate purposes. AWL is a 50:50 joint venture company between the Adani group and the Wilmar group.

Currently, six Adani group companies are listed on domestic bourses. Apart from AEL, other listed ones are Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.No one disputes that Portland metro’s residential real estate market is sizzling hot. There are so few homes for sale and such high demand to buy before mortgage interest rates rise that bidding wars break out for the most desirable properties.

But, seriously. A recently remodeled midcentury modern in the West Hills sold for 30% over the listing price, that is $605,000 more than the owner expected. A 1912 bungalow in Portland’s Laurelhust neighborhood traded hands for 51.4% or $486,000 more than the asking price, all in two weeks.

In the Portland area, multiple offers on homes will most likely continue, say experts, as long as buyers are motivated by the extra buying power they get from locking into historically low, 30-year mortgage interest rates that are around 2.87%.

“If your home is in good shape and clutter free with a maintained yard, you will likely get multiple offers and over list price,” said Lynda O’Neill, a broker with Exceptional Homes by John L. Scott Lake Oswego. “With that being said, it is important to price a home for the market so it sells quickly.”

Here are 10 homes that sold for the most over their asking price in the Portland metro area so far this year, according to a special report the Oregonian/OregonLive requested from real estate marketplace Zillow:

A midcentury house on Southwest Warrens Way in Portland’s West Hills sold on April 20 for $2.6 million, which was 30% over the $1,995,000 asking price.

The 1960 house designed by noted architect Roscoe Hemenway and set on 0.52 acres with valley views has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and 4,178 square feet of living space.

“The sellers had just finished an extensive kitchen and family room remodel, and installed new landscaping and two expansive Ipe decks overlooking the valley,” said listing agent Mj Steen with Macey Laurick of Windermere Realty Trust. “Our office suggested some minor staging items and recommended that they price their home reasonably and let the market determine the ultimate sale price.”

The property was on the market for seven days before one of the eight offers it received was accepted.

A Craftsman-style house on Northeast Davis Street in Portland’s Laurelhurst neighborhood sold on July 2 for $1,431,000, which was 51.4% over the $945,000 asking price.

The recently renovated, 1912 two-story has a family room with a gas fireplace, four bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and 3,714 square feet of living space.

The 4,791-square-foot lot includes an outdoor Viking kitchen and a detached garage.

“Modern twist with hand-picked lighting, gourmet kitchen with Viking six-burner range and Liebherr refrigerator. Re-designed for today with the highest quality,” said listing agent Eugene Park of MORE Realty.

The property was on the market for five days before an offer was accepted. The transaction closed in 15 days.

A Colonial Revival-style house on Southwest Davenport Street in Portland Heights sold on May 4, 2021 for $2.4 million, which was 23.1% over the $1,950,000 asking price.

Respected architect Roscoe Hemenway designed the 1941 dwelling to capture mountain, river and downtown skyline views from nearly every room. The house has four bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and 5,221 square feet of living space.

The 0.57-acre property has an entertaining patio surrounded by an expansive, level yard and mature plantings.

“First time on the market in 80 years, this rare and magical property is perfectly positioned on a picturesque street,” said listing agent Christy MacColl with Carrie Gross of Windermere Realty Trust.

The property was on the market for five days before an offer was accepted.

A 1944 farmhouse on 0.94 acres on Southwest 78th Avenue in Portland’s Raleigh Hills neighborhood sold on July 15 for $1,375,000, which was 44.7% over the $950,000 asking price.

The architecturally designed and remodeled house has an open floor plan with custom built-in cabinetry, floor-to-ceiling windows, three bedrooms, two bathrooms and 2,642 square feet of living space.

“The kitchen has rift-sawn white oak custom cabinetry, quartz and maple counter tops, and porcelain tile. Relax in the spacious owners suite with a walk-in closet and custom bathroom” said listing agent Heather Paris of Paris Group Realty.

The property was on the market for five days before an offer was accepted.

A custom midcentury modern house on Cherry Circle in Lake Oswego’s Skylands community sold on June 30 for $2,110,000, which was 24.9% over the $1,690,000 asking price.

The 55-year-old house, which was on the market for the first time, has walls of windows, vaulted ceilings, five bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and 3,796 square feet of living space with a daylight basement.

The terraced, 0.95-acre lot has river and mountain views visible from a huge deck and hot tub.

“This is the view people talk will about long after they have gone home. Bring vision on how to take this 1966 treasure and create a 2021 jewel,” said listing agent Cricket Forsey of Keller Williams Realty Portland Premiere.

The property was on the market for six days before an offer was accepted.

A ranch-style house on Southwest Willowmere Drive in Portland’s Montclair neighborhood sold on May 25 for $2,105,000, which was 22% over the $1,725,000 asking price.

The updated, 1969 dwelling has white oak floors, an executive home office and a gourmet kitchen with an eight-burner BlueStar range, wine fridge and 11-foot-long island. There are also four bedrooms, three bathrooms and 3,109 square feet of living space.

Sharing the 0.45-acre property is an expansive patio and private yard.

“New A/C units, roof, gutters, garage doors and floor,” said listing agent Kim Kress of Windermere Realty Group.

The property was on the market for seven days before an offer was accepted.

A midcentury modern house on Northwest Melinda Avenue in Portland’s Kings Heights neighborhood sold on May 20 for $1.8 million, which was 12.9% over the $1,595,000 asking price.

On the first full day on the market, 15 qualified buyers and their agents toured the 0.27-acre property. On the second day, listing agent Patrick Clark of Inhabit Real Estate showed the restored and updated home to nine more hopeful buyers. On the third day, offers were reviewed and one was selected.

The residence was built in 1969 and recently renovated by architect Mark Engberg, who founded COLAB Architecture + Urban Design in Portland.

Engberg bought the property in 2005 and invested time and money restoring, updating and expanding the dwelling, which now has 3,309 square feet of living space, four bedrooms, three full bathrooms and a powder room.

Expansive windows under vaulted ceilings and well-placed decks offer “long-lasting” views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams, said Clark. There are raised vegetable beds in the private, tiered yard and a car turntable to display an auto collection in the detached garage.

A midcentury modern house designed by architect Saul Zaik on Southwest 40th Place in Portland’s Bridlemile neighborhood sold on May 14 for $1,264,000, which was 15% over the $1.1 million asking price.

The two-level house, built in 1965, has an open floor plan under skylights and vaulted ceilings, four bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and 3,100 square feet of living space.

“It was back-to-back showings,” said listing agent Gabrielle Enfield of Living Room Realty. “It’s great to see that Saul Zaik’s designs still hold so much reverence and the Portland market is definitely mad for midcentury modern.”

She met “midcentury purists” looking for an architecturally significant home with room to make it their own. They appreciates the 56-year-old house’s original features and signature Zaik details, including the “jaw-dropping great room,” she said.

The 0.46-acre property, which has a swimming pool and overlooks a wooded creek, was on the market for four days before an offer was accepted.

A midcentury modern house in Portland’s Hillsdale neighborhood also caused a storm of responses: Danielle Southern of Keller Williams Portland Premiere said she fielded hundreds of calls, text messages and emails after listing the property on Southwest Richardson Drive on April 14.

The asking price: $829,000. An offer was accepted six days later. The final price: $935,000 or 8.8% more.

The dwelling, built in 1956 on a 6,534-square-foot lot, received $250,000 in recent upgrades including a new roof, plumbing, furnace and central air conditioning. There are four bedrooms, three remodeled bathrooms and a media room among the 2,260 square feet of living space.

“A new state-of-the art kitchen overlooks a private courtyard and open concept great room,” said Southern.

A traditional-style house on Upper Drive in Lake Oswego’s Lake Grove area sold on July 20 for $1,950,000, which was 4% over the $1,875,000 asking price.

The two-story house, built in 2017 on 0.33 acres, has three suites plus a bedroom and a large bonus room as well as 4.5 bathrooms among 4,058 square feet of living space.

“The owners suite on the main floor has two-story ceilings with light pouring in from the sunny southern exposure,” said listing agent Kendall Bergstrom-Delancellotti of The Hasson Company.

The private outdoor covered patio has a water feature, custom fire pit and level lawn. The property includes a swim easement and a three-car garage.HARRISON -- The smell of fresh-pressed jeans, newly unboxed boots, hats and horse tack transports visitors to Whiteaker’s back in time to the days when traditional western stores served the ranching communities. Owned and operated by Joe Whiteaker, the Harrison institution keeps local and regional cowboys outfitted 90 years after Joe’s parents opened the store in the middle of the Great Depression. “He said the banks wouldn’t loan him any money,” Joe said of his dad's effort. Finally, with an $800 loan from a friend and a line of credit from a wholesale house in Denver, E.E. “Abie” and Mary Whiteaker opened their business in the Ted Phillips Building on South Main Street in November 1931. Press Wilson was the store’s first customer, purchasing an overall jacket for $1.69. Abie, a native of Missouri, had arrived in the area in the spring of 1925, going to work for R.N. Henry at the Golden Rule Store in Crawford. Mary Reed relocated to Crawford from eastern Nebraska around the same time to teach school. The couple married in 1928, the same year Abie was tasked with opening and managing a Golden Rule Store in Harrison. But within the first year of business, the stock market crashed and the U.S. plunged into the Great Depression. The Whiteakers were transferred back to Crawford in 1929, but as banks began folding and the economic hardships took their toll on the community, their wages were cut. The couple decided to take the risk of returning to Harrison and opening their own store.

“How well Mary and I remember our starting business,” Abie wrote in an advertisement in the Harrison Sun. “We had little cash, but through the goodness of the town’s people we managed to open with very little merchandise.” Joe said his parents didn’t want the store to look empty on opening day, and that’s why they came up with the idea of filling the shelves with the empty boxes in which their limited merchandise arrived. Three years later, in 1934, the business moved across the corner to the Davis Building. That December brought some excitement to town when the Sioux National Bank was robbed. According to Abie’s recollections printed in the Harrison Sun, he and Mary were working in the store on Dec. 4 with Jerry Kennedy and Lola Unitt. They were busy with Christmas shoppers when bank employee Harold Jefferies ran in to announce the robbery and urge Abie to join him in chasing after the man, who had headed east. Jefferies, Abie, Albert Moody and Lawrence Moody jumped in Abie’s car and overtook the man miles east of town and ran him off the road. The robber exited his vehicle and came out shooting, Abie wrote. “I didn’t have a gun, so believe me, I laid close to the running board on the opposite side of the car, and finally after he had emptied his gun and started running down Smiley Canyon, Albert Moody shot him with a big Army rifle."

Joe said his father, who usually walked to work, was truly shaken by the experience. “He was scared to death after that.” Whiteaker’s moved to its current location in the Hoyt Building in 1938, sharing the site with the U.S. Post Office, as it does today. While getting the business off the ground in the Great Depression was no easy feat, Whiteaker’s was apparently the place to be on a Saturday night. “There would be some 25 or more cowboys who would come to town with their paychecks, and of course we would stay open to accommodate them, sometimes until 11 or 12 o’clock,” Abie wrote in the Harrison Sun. “Their paychecks might not have been very big, but they sure had a good time spending it!” By 1938, Abie and Mary also had three sons, Robert, Donald and Joe. Joe doesn’t remember paying much attention to the store as a child. “I was out mowing yards and making money,” he said, adding that running the store was never in his plans. “I never did think I wanted to come here.” All three boys attended Oklahoma A&M and then served in the armed forces -- Bob in the Air Force, Donald in the Army and Joe in the Marines.

After ending his stint in the Marines, Joe returned to Harrison, marrying Tonita Anderson, and went to work for the Sioux National Bank for 20 years. They also ranched but gave that up during the 1980s farm crisis. With Mary’s passing in 1986 and Abie’s health declining, Joe and Tonita took a more active role in the store during the 1980s, but Abie continued to work until his death in 1989. “The thought of closing was hard. The town really needed it,” Joe said. So, he and Tonita bought out his two brothers, and the days of filling the shelves with empty boxes are long behind them. “We probably have too much inventory, but you have to manage your orders to make the freight worth it,” Joe said. Every surface of the store is filled with jeans, shirts, boots, hats, belts, ties, jewelry and more. Abby Edmund, who has worked at Whiteaker’s for about 10 years, said cowboys from Lusk, Wyoming, to Crawford know they can get what they need. Written down in the back are the styles and sizes of boots, jeans and hats that his loyal customers prefer, Edmund said. “I think it’s nice they don’t have to go elsewhere,” she said. As for Joe, he says meeting and visiting with people is his favorite part of the job, and though it wasn’t what he planned for his life, he’ll be behind the counter until his health prevents it, just like his dad.Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

Hey friends! This week was more than hectic, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Below are more notes on the Brazilian IPO market, more coverage of the Chicago startup scene and a host of numbers from startups concerning their recent growth results. So, if you like early-stage or later-stage startups, international startups or domestic startups, we have just what you want!

Another week, another Twitter conversation about funding rounds. To catch you up, this week saw more folks complaining about the media covering funding rounds over other examples of startup activity. My contention for years has been that we, the scribbling classes, cover funding rounds because they are the rare moment that startups are willing to actually share results of their operations.

That VCs will occasionally complain about this is particularly rich, given that investors would hardly be willing to invest in a company based on a short call with a founder about how they came up with an idea. And yet they tell founders to not tell the media anything at all. Alas.

Regardless, all this shook out to me saying, "Hey startups, send in your data!" And some folks did! Others sent in notes about stuff that they had announced before, but that we’d missed.

So here’s a digest of startup growth from a number of stages, markets and the like:

CopyAI: The company recently crossed the $2 million ARR threshold. CopyAI is busy building its business in public, which we love, sharing metrics as it goes. And it has raised external capital and grown rapidly while doing so, providing a proof point that you can share information and not have your startup instantly burst into flames.

I asked CEO Paul Yacoubian if growth has kept up with his expectations, and he said that it has. Our next question: How long until the company can double in size yet again? CopyAI reached $1 million ARR earlier this year.

TextNow: Now over the $100 million ARR mark. The company, essentially bootstrapped after raising less than $2 million during its life, also recently hired a CFO. You know what that means -- an IPO is coming. Frankly TextNow is not a company I know well, but thanks to it sharing information, I now want to learn more about it. See!

Kalendar AI: This company helps folks book sales meetings using AI, it appears. And the model is showing some traction, according to founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu. He shared a host of metrics with The Exchange, including its bank balance and growth charts. (Hell yeah, data!) The company is generating ARR in the six figures and raised $700,000 in a recent round.

And per its charts, subscriber signups appear to be accelerating. Per a different dataset shared, August is going to be the company’s busiest month yet when it comes to meetings booked, the key non-GAAP metric for its business. That figure is growing at 30% monthly, the startup said.

In Vadrevu’s own phrasing, Kalendar AI wants to “democratize growth for companies like how AWS democratized innovation with virtualization.”

Balto: Balto is a St. Louis-based startup that has raised just over $50 million. The company reached out with some neat data from its recent round, a $37.5 million Series B. Per the company’s COO Chris Kontes, “Jump Capital, OCA Ventures and Sandalphon” took part in the round. Which matters if you read our recent dig into the Chicago market.

Regardless, Balto said that it grew its customer base by 84% and its revenue by 200% since it raised its Series A in Q3 2020. I asked if the ∆ between the company’s customer and revenue growth was driven by net dollar retention (NDR) or larger customers. Per Kontes, “the answer is a bit of both” with a bias toward NDR. He didn’t share an absolute number, but did say that Balto’s “NDR is north of 150%.” Hot dang.

The company, by the by, built tech to help support agents know what to say during calls. Which, it appears, is big business.

HostiFi: Headquartered near Detroit, HostiFi helps customers “remotely monitor and manage UniFi Network devices.” I do not know what that means, sadly, and don’t have the minutes right now to dig in more deeply.

But in better news, HostiFi’s founder Reilly Chase dropped a grip of metrics into our inbox. His company will reach $1 million in ARR in the “next few weeks,” and wants to hit $10 million ARR in “the next 3 years,” which we dig. The company raised $100,000 from what was previously known as Earnest Capital, a group that we’ve covered. HostiFi has 1,700 customers, it says, and a fully remote team of six.

Fun, yeah? Private companies being more open with their financial performance is good for the world as the activity has a way of making the opaque startup world just a bit more limpid.

Our dive into the Brazilian startup market and its impending IPOs was good fun to write. But as we went to press, Brazil’s B3 stock exchange got back to our questions with answers. They just missed our timeline, but we’d be remiss to not share some of their notes here.

Regarding the present state of the Brazilian technology IPO market, B3’s Rafaela Vesterman Araujo wrote the following (minor edits for clarity):

This is precisely the trend that we were trying to highlight, and note, so it’s nice to see the data back us up.

Next up, how big does a company have to be to list on B3? Here’s Vesterman Araujo (minor edits for clarity):

Hello, growth premium! That’s great news for local Brazilian startups hoping to get public in their home market. With Nubank and Nuvemshop growing huge while private, where the country’s companies will go public is no small matter.

We dug into the Chicago boom this week, tracking the Windy City’s huge venture capital results from the past few quarters and asking locals precisely what was driving the wave of funding and startup activity. As we got that into WordPress, another set of answers came in that we want you to read.

Techstars’ Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of its Chicago operations, had this to say about why Chicagoland startups have excelled in attracting capital since late 2020:

I went to school in Chicago, so am pretty aware of the density of schools in the area. I was curious if that fact was beneficial to local startups. Per Sáles-Griffin, the answer is a hard yes:

Where should we look for the next generation of startups from Chicago? The Techstars denizen listed healthcare and life sciences as a key market, as well as food tech and companies building in the larger transit space.

So many other things!

Sadly, we are way over our word count for this newsletter, so we have to stop. But lots of other things out there are worth your attention. Like Indianapolis-based Lessonly being acquired by Seismic. Lessonly had raised just under $30 million while operating on its own, helmed by the dynamo-like Max Yoder. And Aspiration Partners -- backed by a number of well-known actors -- is going public via a SPAC. The deal will provide hundreds of millions in fresh capital to the company.Walmart Canada is building a 223,000-square-foot distribution centre at 135 Frenette Ave. in Moncton, N.B., that is slated to open in fall 2022.

In a news release, Walmart indicated the “next-generation” distribution centre is its first in Atlantic Canada. The plan is for it to provide fresh and frozen groceries to 43 Walmart stores in the region.

The new facility is intended to bring products closer to customers in the region and provide better product availability and quicker service, whether they choose to shop in stores or online.

"This is an exciting time at Walmart Canada as our new distribution centre will be a game changer for our customers, associates and suppliers in Atlantic Canada. We're proud to work with local contractors and suppliers to develop a world-class supply chain that puts our customers first while protecting the planet," Horacio Barbeito, president and CEO of Walmart Canada, stated in the release issue Thursday.

The $56-million project will create more than 200 jobs in Moncton and surrounding communities, including more than 100 inside the distribution centre, according to the company.

The distribution centre, which is being built on 7.7 hectares, “will emphasize environmental sustainability by reducing long-haul truck deliveries and removing millions of kilometres from the supply chain each year,” Walmart Canada stated.

The Moncton facility is one of three Walmart Canada distribution centres under construction. The others are in Surrey, B.C., opening in 2022, and Vaughan, Ont., opening in 2024.

They are part of a total $3.5-billion investment Walmart Canada is making in all aspects of its business over five years.DETROIT – A hearing in Lansing gives a hot mic and the public record to a wild array of vaccine conspiracy talk.

But if you can set that aside, is it ethical for American businesses to enact COVID vaccine mandates? Is it ethical not to?

And while Afghanistan roils from the sudden pullout of American troops, another mideast country has many in Metro Detroit deeply worried. Lebanon in free-fall.

You of course know that the Detroit area is home to the largest Middle Eastern community outside the Middle East.

Even if you have no ties to the Middle East your experience of Middle East culture and certainly food by virtue of living in Detroit comes to you largely via Lebanon.

And right now, the nation of Lebanon is in near economic collapse with no sign of a turnaround on the horizon.

The match was the first with fans at Seville’s Benito Villamarín Stadium since the start of pandemic restrictions in March 2020. Some 23,000 spectators were allowed to attend the match, 40% of capacity as set by health authorities.

Negredo put the visitors ahead in the 11th minute with a penalty thanks to the watchful eyes of the referee, who had ordered the spot kick to be repeated.

Goalkeeper Rui Silva saved Negredo's first penalty but had both feet off the line. The veteran striker did not waste his chance to make up for the miss.

“My first kick was horrible and he made a good save,” Negredo said. “But on the second try I had a clearer idea of what I wanted and put it in. Any time we take points on the road it is a good result."

Betis equalized in the 22nd when Juanmi Jiménez headed home from a corner kick taken by Nabil Fekir, who caused Cádiz trouble throughout the match with his speed and footwork.

Fekir hit the post from outside the area in the 37th, a few minutes after Cádiz’s Tomás Alarcón had also found the woodwork on a counterattack.

Another incursion into the area by Fekir almost led to a go-ahead goal by Betis when his deflected shot fell to Sergio Canales close to the net, only for Canales to send his effort high.

“I had a chance but didn’t finish it off,” Canales said. “It was a clear opportunity that could have decided the match.”

Ledesma protected the point when he blocked a shot by Joaquin Sánchez with one minute to play after another inspired run by Fekir left the substitute free in the box.

It was a second straight draw for both sides to start the league season.Ample aims to make its batteries and swapping process more widely available to different brands.

Ample, a San Francisco-based developer of swappable electric vehicle (EV) batteries, has raised $160 million in a new funding round, the company said on Thursday.

The company has developed a battery for EVs and an automated process for quickly swapping out depleted batteries for newly charged packs, according to founders Khaled Hassounah and John de Souza.

The Series C round brings to $230 million the total raised by the seven-year-old startup, which plans to expand testing and deployment to New York City, then Madrid and Singapore, Hassounah said in an interview.

"We've been saying for the past few months that this technology is ready for prime time, so now we intend to prove it" by expanding the fledgling service to more cities and drivers, he said.

Long charging times that are common at most public and commercial charging stations have dampened consumer and fleet demand for electric vehicles.

Ample is part of a growing group of companies, including Chinese EV makers Nio and Xpeng, trying to revive and update an old idea: Leapfrog charging hurdles by offering quick battery swaps to EV owners concerned about running out of juice while driving.

Unlike the Chinese carmakers, Ample aims to make its batteries and swapping process more widely available to different brands.

Hassounah and de Souza say their process can replace a depleted battery with a fully charged one in less than 10 minutes, using an automated process that "works with any electric vehicle" at a cost "as cheap as gasoline."

Ample's financial backers include corporate investors Shell and Repsol as well as energy providers such as Japan's Eneos and Thailand's PTT.

Automated battery swap "could solve a big problem" for energy companies and commercial operators that are moving their fleets to electric power and cannot afford downtime for extended charging, de Souza said.

The drivers, who deliver orders for the online retailer’s rapid delivery service, Ocado Zoom, were previously guaranteed an hourly wage of £14. But they are not employed directly by Ocado and claim their income plunged after the company brought in a new delivery partner, Ryde, in June.

Faizan Babar, who has been delivering Ocado groceries for more than two years, said he could not afford to take his two young daughters on holiday this year or replace their broken scooter. “I’m making on average £50 on a 10-hour shift. And we pay for our own cars, tax, fuel and insurance out of that. It works out less than £5 an hour. Ocado is treating us like dirt.”

Babar, 30, works from 7am to 8pm some days just to keep up with his bills – anything else is a luxury he cannot afford. “I can’t give any time to my daughters or wife. I can’t even take them on a day out,” he said. “My daughter wants to go to Chessington [theme park] but I can’t afford it. I feel horrible. I can’t talk to her about it.”

Babar said that many of his colleagues had seen their earnings fall by between 50% and 70% since Ryde took over from Ocado’s previous delivery partner.

Payslips seen by the Observer show that Babar earned an estimated £5 an hour in the first week of August and £2.91 an hour in the last week of July. “It’s not enough to survive on. I’m having to claim universal credit,” he said. “Every one of us is struggling.”

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the drivers, said Ocado should take responsibility for the plight of a loyal group of workers who carried on working throughout successive lockdowns. “These drivers are key workers who risked their lives during the pandemic delivering vital supplies for Ocado but are now seeing their pay slashed by a company that has seen profits skyrocket,” said Alex Marshall, the union’s president.

“They should be treated as the heroes they are. Ocado needs to take responsibility and bring these workers in-house.”

The union will send an open letter to Ocado this week, accusing the company of abandoning a precarious and predominately minority ethnic workforce. It warns that the IWGB will begin a public campaign against Ocado unless it enters into negotiations. The company reported group profits that rose by nearly £30m to £73.1m in February, but has recently seen sales slip as shoppers return to pre-Covid habits.

But the rapid delivery market is expanding, with huge amounts of venture capital pouring into courier firms attempting to replace smaller top-up purchases made in corner shops with ultra-quick drop-offs, usually within an hour of ordering. Ocado, whose CEO, Tim Steiner, received a £58.7m pay packet in 2019, is planning to roll out Ocado Zoom across Britain, with at least 12 “micro fulfilment centres” due to open.

Ocado, which is half-owned by Marks & Spencer, said: “Ocado Zoom works with a number of third-party suppliers, and expects all of them to adhere to its high standards.”

Ryde, which is backed by some of the world’s largest venture capitalists and high-profile tech investors, said it was a “rider first” last-mile delivery business, with drivers free to work as it best suits them. “We put the welfare of our workforce at the heart of everything that we do,” said a spokesperson.

“On average, workers on our platform earn 15% to 20% more than other gig economy businesses. We constantly champion improved conditions for them across the board.”

Other drivers based at the Ocado Zoom depot have also come forward. Ahmed Fahim, who has been dropping off Ocado groceries since 2019, said he was earning around £200 a week on the Ryde app. “I worked throughout the pandemic because I had to put food on the table. I got Covid when my wife was pregnant. But there is no appreciation or respect for the risks we took for them,” he said. “Ocado treats people like shit.”

Payslips seen by the Observer show that Fahim, who was working 14 hours, seven days a week, earned an estimated £4.63 an hour for the first week in August and £3.80 an hour in the last week of July. Fahim, 27, said he had been forced to cut back on everything apart from essentials to avoid going further into debt or having to use a food bank. “It’s a horrible feeling that you work for a company like Ocado for three years and nobody asks you how you are doing,” he said.

Another driver, Jakaria Rehman, 35, said he was earning around £3 an hour. “Ocado is disgraceful. They say we don’t work for Ocado but we are delivering for them. They don’t appreciate us,” he said.

The drivers have even been made to buy new smart clothes. Ryde specifies on the app that “tracksuits… are not acceptable and may result in you not being able to work the shift”. Babar, who worked throughout the lockdowns despite being classed as clinically vulnerable, said it was yet another expense the couriers were expected to bear themselves. “Jeans and shirts are more than £50, and you need to have at least two or three pairs. It is at least a couple of hundred pounds that we don’t have,” he said.

The size of the deliveries, which can include cans of beer and bottles of wine, is growing, according to the drivers. When the drivers started, they were expected to take groceries that fitted in two courier bags, now it is four bags. They claim they are frequently asked to take even more, with the Observer shown pictures of shopping overflowing from four bags.

“They used to split heavy loads but Ryde is forcing us to take whatever Ocado gives us. Sometimes we get five bags’ worth,” said Babar. “Most drivers have shoulder and back pain.”

One driver has to take painkillers to get through the working day. “Every delivery is at least 30kg to 40kg. If you are making 20 or 30 trips, you are carrying more than 1,000kg every day,” said Fahim. “I have to take painkillers because my back and knees hurt.”

Attempts to to discuss the worsening situation with Ocado and Ryde have proved frustrating for the drivers. “Ocado is hiding behind Ryde. They say talk to your employer, you are nothing to do with us,” said Babar. “But Ryde blame Ocado and say they cannot pay us any more. We have nowhere to go – we keep going back and forth.”Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's campaign for COVID-19 vaccinations gained a new voice with a highly personal testimonial — a one-time vaccine skeptic recounting his debilitating fight against the virus.

Ethan Koehler (Kay'-ler) spoke in stark terms of his journey from downplaying the pandemic to being laid low by excruciating pain, struggles to breathe and then “relearning” to walk without losing his breath as the coronavirus ravaged his health.

“I was very, very big on anti-COVID, anti-vaccine,” Koehler said. "I made Facebook posts, public posts, talked to people, made a big deal about it. Made a point to not wear a mask. Made a point to say that COVID wasn’t important. And I am eating crow on it, because I experienced it.”

Koehler's video message was shown at Beshear's media briefing Thursday afternoon. After months of imploring Kentuckians to take the COVID-19 shots, the governor has turned increasingly to others to help make the case. His briefings routinely feature doctors and nurses warning of the growing risks for the unvaccinated as the fast-spreading delta variant causes the state's worst surge of the pandemic to date.

The 28-year-old Koehler's ordeal highlighted another alarming trend — growing infection rates among younger Kentuckians, who are less likely to be vaccinated. Just 41% of Kentuckians ages 18-29 have received at least a first dose of vaccine, compared to 84% among people 65 and older.

Overall, more than 2.4 million Kentuckians have received at least one vaccine dose, accounting for 55% of the state’s population. Most of the state's COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths since March 1 of this year have been among partially vaccinated or unvaccinated Kentuckians.

On Friday, Beshear reported 3,869 new COVID-19 cases statewide and six more virus-related deaths. The rate of Kentucky residents testing positive for the virus increased again, to 12.8%.

Koehler, who is from Benton in far western Kentucky, contracted the virus in July and was hospitalized for 17 days. The pain grew so intense that “every time I took a breath, it felt like somebody was sitting on the right side of my chest, and with a knife,” he said in a phone interview Friday. He credits his doctors with saving his life.

In the video, Koehler said he always thought he was able to “handle some stuff,” but when he was fighting for breath, “that was when I realized, this is really bad right now. I can’t even tough it out.”

It also led him to reevaluate the social media pronouncements he had made about the pandemic.

“Having COVID, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody," he said in the video. "It’s because of COVID I have to fight now every day to get a little bit better. I’m relearning how to walk without catching my breath.

"If I knew that a vaccination would have taken 75% or even half of my struggles the last month out ... I would have gotten it in a heartbeat and I would have never looked back,” he added.

Beshear praised Koehler for coming forward to share his dramatic story. But the governor also said it reflected “the dangers of misinformation” hindering the fight against the virus.

“One of the most difficult things that we face in our fight against this virus is folks either putting out information that is blatantly false or sometimes intentionally lying,” Beshear said.

He warned Thursday that the state’s hospitals are filling up as the delta variant accelerates the outbreak, and that every “staffable bed” could be in use within a week and a half.

Chastened by his experience, Koehler said he's backed off from heated social media exchanges about the pandemic.

“I still believe it’s your right to choose what you want to do,” he said by phone. "But I guess the blunt side of it would be, if you don’t want to get the vaccine, then don’t complain when you’re stuck in the hospital parking lot and can’t breathe because it’s full.”Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

Hey friends! This week was more than hectic, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Below are more notes on the Brazilian IPO market, more coverage of the Chicago startup scene and a host of numbers from startups concerning their recent growth results. So, if you like early-stage or later-stage startups, international startups or domestic startups, we have just what you want!

Another week, another Twitter conversation about funding rounds. To catch you up, this week saw more folks complaining about the media covering funding rounds over other examples of startup activity. My contention for years has been that we, the scribbling classes, cover funding rounds because they are the rare moment that startups are willing to actually share results of their operations.

That VCs will occasionally complain about this is particularly rich, given that investors would hardly be willing to invest in a company based on a short call with a founder about how they came up with an idea. And yet they tell founders to not tell the media anything at all. Alas.

Regardless, all this shook out to me saying, "Hey startups, send in your data!" And some folks did! Others sent in notes about stuff that they had announced before, but that we’d missed.

So here’s a digest of startup growth from a number of stages, markets and the like:

CopyAI: The company recently crossed the $2 million ARR threshold. CopyAI is busy building its business in public, which we love, sharing metrics as it goes. And it has raised external capital and grown rapidly while doing so, providing a proof point that you can share information and not have your startup instantly burst into flames.

I asked CEO Paul Yacoubian if growth has kept up with his expectations, and he said that it has. Our next question: How long until the company can double in size yet again? CopyAI reached $1 million ARR earlier this year.

TextNow: Now over the $100 million ARR mark. The company, essentially bootstrapped after raising less than $2 million during its life, also recently hired a CFO. You know what that means -- an IPO is coming. Frankly TextNow is not a company I know well, but thanks to it sharing information, I now want to learn more about it. See!

Kalendar AI: This company helps folks book sales meetings using AI, it appears. And the model is showing some traction, according to founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu. He shared a host of metrics with The Exchange, including its bank balance and growth charts. (Hell yeah, data!) The company is generating ARR in the six figures and raised $700,000 in a recent round.

And per its charts, subscriber signups appear to be accelerating. Per a different dataset shared, August is going to be the company’s busiest month yet when it comes to meetings booked, the key non-GAAP metric for its business. That figure is growing at 30% monthly, the startup said.

In Vadrevu’s own phrasing, Kalendar AI wants to “democratize growth for companies like how AWS democratized innovation with virtualization.”

Balto: Balto is a St. Louis-based startup that has raised just over $50 million. The company reached out with some neat data from its recent round, a $37.5 million Series B. Per the company’s COO Chris Kontes, “Jump Capital, OCA Ventures and Sandalphon” took part in the round. Which matters if you read our recent dig into the Chicago market.

Regardless, Balto said that it grew its customer base by 84% and its revenue by 200% since it raised its Series A in Q3 2020. I asked if the ∆ between the company’s customer and revenue growth was driven by net dollar retention (NDR) or larger customers. Per Kontes, “the answer is a bit of both” with a bias toward NDR. He didn’t share an absolute number, but did say that Balto’s “NDR is north of 150%.” Hot dang.

The company, by the by, built tech to help support agents know what to say during calls. Which, it appears, is big business.

HostiFi: Headquartered near Detroit, HostiFi helps customers “remotely monitor and manage UniFi Network devices.” I do not know what that means, sadly, and don’t have the minutes right now to dig in more deeply.

But in better news, HostiFi’s founder Reilly Chase dropped a grip of metrics into our inbox. His company will reach $1 million in ARR in the “next few weeks,” and wants to hit $10 million ARR in “the next 3 years,” which we dig. The company raised $100,000 from what was previously known as Earnest Capital, a group that we’ve covered. HostiFi has 1,700 customers, it says, and a fully remote team of six.

Fun, yeah? Private companies being more open with their financial performance is good for the world as the activity has a way of making the opaque startup world just a bit more limpid.

Our dive into the Brazilian startup market and its impending IPOs was good fun to write. But as we went to press, Brazil’s B3 stock exchange got back to our questions with answers. They just missed our timeline, but we’d be remiss to not share some of their notes here.

Regarding the present state of the Brazilian technology IPO market, B3’s Rafaela Vesterman Araujo wrote the following (minor edits for clarity):

This is precisely the trend that we were trying to highlight, and note, so it’s nice to see the data back us up.

Next up, how big does a company have to be to list on B3? Here’s Vesterman Araujo (minor edits for clarity):

Hello, growth premium! That’s great news for local Brazilian startups hoping to get public in their home market. With Nubank and Nuvemshop growing huge while private, where the country’s companies will go public is no small matter.

We dug into the Chicago boom this week, tracking the Windy City’s huge venture capital results from the past few quarters and asking locals precisely what was driving the wave of funding and startup activity. As we got that into WordPress, another set of answers came in that we want you to read.

Techstars’ Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of its Chicago operations, had this to say about why Chicagoland startups have excelled in attracting capital since late 2020:

I went to school in Chicago, so am pretty aware of the density of schools in the area. I was curious if that fact was beneficial to local startups. Per Sáles-Griffin, the answer is a hard yes:

Where should we look for the next generation of startups from Chicago? The Techstars denizen listed healthcare and life sciences as a key market, as well as food tech and companies building in the larger transit space.

So many other things!

Sadly, we are way over our word count for this newsletter, so we have to stop. But lots of other things out there are worth your attention. Like Indianapolis-based Lessonly being acquired by Seismic. Lessonly had raised just under $30 million while operating on its own, helmed by the dynamo-like Max Yoder. And Aspiration Partners -- backed by a number of well-known actors -- is going public via a SPAC. The deal will provide hundreds of millions in fresh capital to the company.Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

Paris, Tenn., a small town located near the state's border with Kentucky, is known mostly as the home of the world's largest fish fry.

But, learning one style of music in a place that is not known for it gave Johnsonius Neubert a deep appreciation for other styles of music, which she honed while attending Sarah Lawrence College outside New York City.

Living in New York also led her into other facets of the performing arts business, including fundraising, curating and directing, fields in which musicians don't always tread.

Last year, Johnsonius Neubert brought all those skills to a new position, executive director of the Berkshire Music School in Pittsfield, which was founded by Winnie Davis Long Crane in 1940.

We talked with the Lenox resident recently about her background in the performing arts, how she became involved in so many aspects of the field, and where she would like to take the Berkshire Music School.

Q: You have a lot of experience in fundraising and curating and directing, yet, you're also a classically trained musician. That seems like an unusual skill set for someone in the performing arts. It's usually one or the other. How did you get involved in both?

A: I started playing piano when I was very young [age 4].

I grew up in a small town. I was very traditionally trained in classical music. Then, when I was looking for colleges, I was interested in music, theater and writing. I went to Sarah Lawrence, and Sarah Lawrence allows you to do all of those things and focus on a high level of artistry. By doing all those things, you don't get pigeonholed into one category.

Q: Is that when you began to branch out?

A: When I got to Sarah Lawrence, I started working with musicians that weren't just Western European classical musicians; a lot of contemporary and new music came out of Sarah Lawrence.

I had a mentor, and he introduced me to new music and what they used to call avant-garde music, like Bang on a Can, Meredith Monk, John Zorn. ... At the same time, I was doing a lot of device theater, and I played saxophone. I had a lot of different angles coming at the same thing.

Q: How did you get involved in the administrative side of the business?

A: When I was in college, there was a presenting house in New York called "The Kitchen." That's where video art, contemporary music and literature take place; it was one of the first avant-garde producers in New York.

I took an internship there and got very close to the executive director. She gave me a chance to see all the files of the history of the organization, all the musical files, the video art. It was eye-opening, and I really learned a lot about other types of art. ...

I was really interested in how art evolves and morphs and how one can be an artist and a performer and not be pigeonholed into being a classical pianist, knowing that there's a foundation for everything. She's the one who taught me that as long as you find the money for it, you can produce anything you want. That's when I started raising money and producing as a means to say this is how I want to create and how can I make it happen?

Q: What attracted you to raising money?

A: I spent most of my 20s in New York. It's very, very hard to get seen and break in as an actor, as a director, as a musician, anything. But, there are also a lot of small venues.

A lot of people will give a small artist a chance if it's not going to cost them anything, right? So, if you're able to find the money and work hard at a way of producing art, then you can get a foot in the door.

I just worked very, very long hours in my 20s. If I wasn't in rehearsal, then I was working a day job, and all my day jobs fed into my art itself. My day jobs were raising money, doing public relations, doing marketing and curating. ...

Because I was so young, I had a lot of early successes. One of the first shows I produced won a Bessie (The Bessies, named after esteemed choreographer and dance teacher Bessie Schonberg, recognize work by independent dance artists in New York City). So, that opened a lot more doors for me to curate and put on the kind of art that I was interested in.

Q: What do you like better, the performance or administrative side of the business?

A: It sort of depends on the day and the phase of my life. It's also important for me to have a family. We live up here for a reason. ... So, sometimes it's family time and sometimes its time for management.

In the last several years, I've been trying to incorporate those things more and to be more concerned about what projects I want to take on, what do I think will make a difference in the community.

When I went back to grad school, one of my professors said that the way you can be the best artist that you can be is to find the story that needs telling and tell it only the way you can tell it. Sometimes the reason is, I'm the best sound designer. Sometimes it's I'm the best producer for it.

I'm not the most talented musician that's going to come out of Berkshire County, but I can easily see a niche that the Berkshire Music School fills, that I can help achieve.

Q: Based on your previous experience and the Berkshire Music School's mission, it seems like this job combines everything you like to do. Am I correct?

A: Absolutely. When the job came up, I had been working part time at Shakespeare & Company as their fundraiser. This came up right at the time of the pandemic (Johnsonius Neubert was named the school's executive director in May 2020).

There was something about the position and it being a small organization where I could see the chance to make real change to the community through the organization. ... I know "artist" means a lot of things to a lot of different people. When I think of "artist," it's using any means necessary for change for growth to cultivate beauty. It's not just about playing Mozart. It's about seeing that music in this community is more than the sum of any of its parts.

Q: How does all of that factor into what the Berkshire Music School's current mission is?

A: We're in a year of change, so, the pandemic has allowed us to slow down. We had most of our lessons and classes online last year. It really gave us a chance to think about what are we doing, what are the programs, and with me being new and having a slightly different view of the organization.

[The Berkshire Music School] was started by Winnie Davis Crane. Her idea was that there should be a music school, music education, for the entire community, not just people that can afford it. To me, that means music lessons, that means group classes, that means bringing people together.

It became very clear this year that the social aspects of music were just as important as the artistic aspect of music. Just the act of bringing people together to make something together is very important to me.

So, the Berkshires are changing. Western European music is an important foundation, but we have a lot of musical voices here. ... It's important to me that the music school reflect all of those voices and that we inspire all of those people and meet them where they are, so you don't need to be on your way to Juilliard to be a classical violinist. That's great, that's fantastic, and we're going to keep encouraging those musicians as well.

But, African drumming reaches a different audience, and what they used to call global or world music reaches another audience. Electronic music reaches another audience. Everybody benefits from having participated in music.

Thank you very much!Washington, August 21 (Xinhua)-US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told White House senior advisers that she would support the reappointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, local media. Reported on Saturday.

Bloomberg quoted those familiar with the matter and reported that the White House was looking for more candidates and that US President Joe Biden had not yet made a decision.

Yellen’s support will give Powell a great boost as Powell has nearly 20 years of experience at the central bank, the report said. crisis.

Powell was appointed chairman of the Fed in February 2018 after being appointed to replace Yellen by former President Donald Trump in November 2017. The Federal Reserve Board has a four-year term.

Yellen’s support comes at an important time. Powell will give a long-awaited speech at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium on August 27, which may provide further clues about the Fed’s taper program.

According to the minutes of a recent Federal Reserve Board of Governance (FRB) policy meeting, most FRB officials said last month that the central bank would taper off asset purchases this year if the U.S. economy develops significantly as expected. He said it might be appropriate to get started.

The Federal Reserve Board has decided to keep benchmark rates at near-zero levels, a record low, while continuing the asset purchase program at a current pace of at least US $ 120 billion per month until “substantial further progress” is made.

A real-estate agent in Washington is having a bit of fun with the listing photos for his latest Spokane-area property, most of which show a fully armored “knight” enjoying the home’s amenities.

The house itself, located in Chattaroy, was already constructed to resemble a castle, featuring a massive exterior “fortress wall” topped with battlements. It only made sense, then, that it should be marketed in an appropriate way, says agent Jonas Elber.

“I have enjoyed marketing unique properties in the past,” said Elber, who explained that he enlisted an actual armorer, along with a few of his friends, to help bring his vision to reality. “They all jumped on the idea and were great to work with.”

Their efforts resulted not only a series of silly listing photos, but also a short film that depicts the “knight” giving a tour of the $600,000 property. In it, he can be seen playing hockey in the courtyard, slicing fruit with his sword, and, yes, utilizing one of the home’s throne rooms.

Elber says the idea has generated plenty of exposure, but more importantly, it attracted the eye of several potential buyers.

“When this home was previously listed in 2009 it sat on the market for over 400 days and stuck out like a sore thumb,” Elber said. This time around, however, he claims over a dozen qualified buyers have toured the home, which hit the market only days ago. This weekend, he’s getting ready to review a few offers, too.

“We are happy to see so many buyers enthusiastic about the castle and the potential it has as a residence, potential wedding venue, or Airbnb,” he said.The U.S. Postal Service is offering up to a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of whoever's responsible for a robbery of a postal worker in Alabama.

Officials said the incident happened Friday, shortly before 3 p.m. in Montgomery's Gibbs Village area, WSFA-TV reported.

The U.S. Postal Service Inspector's Office has launched an investigation. Postal Inspector Tony Robinson said there are few details other than where the robbery occurred.Around 300 Indian nationals are expected to be brought back home from Afghanistan on Sunday as part of India's evacuation mission in view of the deteriorating security situation in the Afghan capital Kabul, people familiar with the development said.

Eighty-seven Indians were on Saturday taken to Tajikistan capital Dushanbe from Kabul on board a military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force and the group is being brought back to Delhi in a special Air India flight from the central Asian city early on Sunday.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted that two Nepalese citizens are also coming to India on board the Air India flight.

''Bringing Indians home from Afghanistan! AI 1956 carrying 87 Indians departs from Tajikistan for New Delhi. Two Nepalese nationals also evacuated. Assisted and supported by our Embassy @IndEmbDushanbe. More evacuation flights to follow,'' Bagchi tweeted at around 1:20 am.

He said the passengers were earlier evacuated from Kabul by an IAF aircraft.

Separately, the Indian embassy in Qatar said 135 Indians, who were evacuated from Kabul to Doha in the last few days, are being sent to India.

''1st batch of 135 Indians who were evacuated 4m Kabul to Doha over past days being repatriated tonight to India,'' the embassy said in a post-midnight tweet.

It said embassy officials provided consular and logistics assistance to ensure the safe return of the Indians.

''We thank Qatar authorities n all concerned for making this possible,'' it added.

It is learnt that the Indians evacuated to Doha from Kabul were employees of a number of foreign companies that were operating in Afghanistan. The Indians were flown into Doha by US and NATO aircraft.

The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that close to 100 Indians are likely to be brought back to India from Kabul in an Indian Air Force heavy-lift aircraft by Sunday.

The total number of Indians to be evacuated on Sunday is around 300, they said.

India has already evacuated 200 people including the Indian envoy and other staffers of its embassy in Kabul in two C-17 heavy-lift transport aircraft of the IAF after the Taliban seized control of Kabul on Sunday.

The first evacuation flight brought back over 40 people, mostly staffers at the Indian embassy, on Monday.

The second C-17 aircraft evacuated around 150 people including Indian diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians from Kabul on Tuesday.

The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities including Kabul in the backdrop of the withdrawal of the US forces.

The mission to evacuate close to 200 Indians was accomplished with support from the US.

Following the evacuation, the MEA said the focus now would be to ensure the safe return of all Indian nationals from the Afghan capital.

The MEA said the immediate priority for the government is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently staying in Afghanistan.

It also requested the Indians as well as their employers to urgently share the relevant details with the special Afghanistan cell.

As per a rough estimate earlier, the number of Indians stranded in Afghanistan could be around 400 and India has been looking at ways to evacuate them including by coordinating with the US and other friendly countries.The U.S. Postal Service is offering up to a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of whoever's responsible for a robbery of a postal worker in Alabama.

The military brought him to Langley Air Force Base in Hampton and after four years of active duty, he realized his true calling of business ownership.

In 2007, he joined Virginia Beach-based Plaza Group, which started in 1989. As managing principal, Shah currently owns and operates 14 hotels, two convenience stores, seven Tropical Smoothies, and two Edible Arrangements throughout Hampton Roads and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Most recently in July, he founded Pashm Global, a hotel management and land development company that he leads as CEO in Virginia Beach.

Since 2004, he has been involved with the Hindu Temple of Hampton Roads in Chesapeake where he serves as a board member and secretary. A member of Entrepreneurs’ Organization and Young Presidents’ Organization, he is also an ambassador for the Asian American Hotel Owners Association in Washington, D.C., and vice president of the Virginia Asian American Store Owners Association.

He stepped up during the pandemic, facilitating a vaccination drive in partnership with Hague Pharmacy in March. In just a few weeks, the clinic provided more than 9,200 people with COVID-19 vaccines. He was also instrumental in helping to raise $185,000 to help with COVID relief in India.

For two years, he has been the chair of sponsorship and advertising for Norfolk’s annual Taste of India, one of the largest Asian Indian festivals in Virginia. Canceled in 2020 and 2021, Shah said festival leaders are looking forward to bringing the large-scale event back next year.

“In a relatively short period of time, he has grown his multiple businesses while continuing to learn with passion,” Kothari said. “In my opinion, he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs I have known. The main reason I say this is because he has earned respect alongside achieving financial success.”President Joe Biden is facing a summer slump, with Americans taking a notably less positive view of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his job approval rating ticking down.

A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 54% of Americans approve of Biden’s job performance, down slightly from 59% last month. While that's still a relatively solid rating for a president during his first year in office, particularly given the nation's deep political polarization, it's a worrying sign for Biden as he faces the greatest domestic and foreign policy challenges of his presidency so far.

The biggest warning sign for the president in the survey centers on his handling of the pandemic. Last month, 66% of Americans approved of his stewardship of the public health crisis; now, that number has fallen to 54%, driven by a drop in support from Republicans and independents.

That decline in support coincides with other storm clouds gathering over Biden's presidency, most notably the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan as U.S. troops withdraw and the Taliban cement their control of the country.

The poll, conducted August 12-16, as news of the Taliban’s movement into Kabul was widely reported in the United States, shows Americans about evenly divided over Biden’s handling of foreign policy (47% approve, 51% disapprove) and national security (52% approve, 46% disapprove).

Biden's domestic policy agenda also faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill, with Democratic leaders trying to mend party divisions over a pair of infrastructure bills and few signs of progress on voting rights or police overhaul legislation.

Still, Biden's advisers believe his presidency is likely to rise or fall on his handling of the pandemic. As recently as early summer, the White House was all but declaring victory over the virus, backing the lifting of public health restrictions and encouraging vaccinated Americans to enjoy a return to normalcy this summer. Polling showed Biden winning plaudits for his approach to the pandemic not only from nearly all Democrats, but also a healthy share of Republicans.

Some of that support has eroded as a dangerous new strain of COVID-19 takes hold, worries about the virus grow and vaccination rates in the U.S. stall, leading more communities, businesses and schools to reinstate restrictions such as mask mandates that were lifted earlier this year when trends were heading in a more positive direction.

Biden has implored Americans to get vaccinated and has put in place vaccine requirements where he can, for federal workers and the military. But resistance to the vaccine has proven stubborn, largely in more conservative parts of the country that are now experiencing startling increases in COVID-19 cases.

“I think a lot of that is out of his hands,” said Judy Kunzman, 75, a Democrat from Middletown, Pennsylvania. “If he gets too dictatorial, there will be a lot more blowback.”

But Jeanette Ellis-Carter, 69, wants to see Biden push for more vaccine mandates across the nation. Despite being fully vaccinated, the Cincinnati resident recently contracted COVID-19 and worries that without vaccine requirements, more Americans will be at risk of getting sick.

“When I was a child in school, we were mandated to get the polio shot, measles. What's any different about this?" she said.

Republican officials have led the opposition to the vaccine and mask measures that the Biden administration has put in place this summer. The August AP-NORC poll shows just 21% of Republicans approve of Biden on COVID-19, down from 32% last month and 43% in June. Among independents, 44% now support his handling of the pandemic, down from 72% last month.

Those shifts bring Biden's approval rating on the pandemic more in line with the public's views of his handling of other major issues, which largely split along partisan lines.

For example, the poll shows 49% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy and 49% disapprove. That's down from 57% approval in April.

The White House is hoping that fall will bring final passage of a pair of sweeping bills that would pump money into the economy for infrastructure projects, as well as spending on health care, education and family services.

Biden cheered Senate passage of a hard-won, $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed with bipartisan support. But that measure and a $3.5 trillion budget bill muscled through the Senate by Democrats face uncertain futures in the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is trying to navigate between moderates who balk at the bigger bill's price tag and progressives who insist it's the price to be paid for their support of the bipartisan measure.

Another metric to watch for the White House: Americans have soured somewhat on the direction of the country, with 39% saying the nation is headed in the right direction, while 61% say it’s the wrong direction. Last month, 44% said the nation is headed the right way.Arizona is on pace to record its 1 millionth COVID-19 infection within the next week, and health experts fear that kids in schools and the looming Labor Day holiday will only make the state’s COVID-19 surge worse.

The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 979,580 cases as of Friday and its data shows that the state had been averaging 2,941 new cases every day over the past week, as the highly contagious delta variant continued its spread.

Another 53 people died Friday from COVID-19 in Arizona, bringing the death toll in the state to 18,561.

Despite new the COVID-19 surge, health experts said that Arizona continues to lack aggressive mitigation efforts that they said could stem the tide.

“For some time, you certainly haven’t been as aggressive with mask-wearing and vaccination,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said of the state.

State officials have refused to issue a mask mandate and Gov. Doug Ducey this week issued an order banning local governments from enforcing vaccination requirements. That came the same week that Ducey unveiled a “relief program” that would direct federal COVID-19 funds to schools that do not enforce mask mandates.

Given the lax mandates in the state, Benjamin said residents have an even greater “degree of personal responsibility” for fighting the virus, especially with the upcoming Labor Day holiday that he expects will worsen exposure.

“At the end of the day, the solution is vaccination,” Benjamin said.

The unvaccinated are at higher risk of infection and more likely to contract and transmit the virus, but only 54.7% of Arizonans had received at least one dose of vaccine as of Friday, according to AZDHS. Nationally, the rate was 72.7%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

An AZDHS spokesperson said the agency “has worked nonstop” to make vaccines readily available, to reach out to underserved communities and to ensure residents that the vaccine is safe and is their best defense.

“Whatever your reasons for not getting vaccinated, the numbers make it clear that safe, free and widely available vaccines offer highly effective protection against COVID-19, including the delta variant,” said Steve Elliott, communications director for the AZDHS.

In Maricopa County, which has the bulk of the cases in the state, more than 1.7 million residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine, but there is still “a long way to go,” said Dr. Nick Staab, medical epidemiologist with the county health department.

Staab said Friday he does not expect vaccination rates to be at a point by Labor Day where health officials can comfortably rely on the vaccine alone to slow the surge. Regardless, he still encouraged people to get vaccinated if they haven’t already.

All 15 counties in the state were in the “high community transmission” category as of Friday, up from 11 that were in that category at the beginning of the month, according to the CDC.

“These things tend to burn themselves out even if there are no vaccinations, but we can get the numbers down much faster if we can get more people vaccinated,” said Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute.

LaBaer encourages those who are not vaccinated to get the shot, as well as “doing all the things we know work,” such as social distancing and wearing face masks.

Taking these precautions can help keep children safe, said LaBaer, who noted that about 25% of cases in the state are people under age 18. Many of them cannot get vaccinated – vaccines have not been approved for those under 12 – and they are now back in school.

Because they cannot yet get the vaccine, experts say the best way for young children to reduce their exposure to the virus is through mask-wearing and social distancing. But with Ducey’s recent proposal discouraging mask requirements for schools, the chances children will be exposed are high, said Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association.

Ducey is “paying schools to put their students’ health and safety at risk and ignore CDC mitigation efforts,” Humble said, adding that the “relief program” will unnecessarily cause children to be exposed to the virus.

Humble blames the COVID-19 surge on the governor’s failure to enforce mitigation measures, which has made Arizona a “poor performer.”

“I don’t see anything on the horizon policywise from this governor or whoever the next health director is,” he said.

Policy or no policy, “the basics still fly,” Benjamin said.

“That is, wash your hands, stay out of large crowds… and get vaccinated,” he said.SYDNEY — Authorities in Australia say more than 250 people have been arrested while protesting coronavirus lockdowns in the country. Many faced fines for defying health orders.

The protests took place Saturday in several cities nationwide, with the largest and most violent protest in Melbourne. At least seven police officers were treated for injuries after skirmishes broke out at some of the protests.

Sydney has been in lockdown for two months, while Melbourne and Australia's capital, Canberra, went into lockdown earlier this month. Under the rules of the lockdown, people are mostly confined to their homes and have limits placed on their social interactions.

Protestors say the lockdowns should end, but authorities say they are necessary to suppress the spread of the virus and save lives.

Despite the restrictions, Sydney’s New South Wales state reported a record 825 new daily community infections on Saturday. Several cities are battling outbreaks of the highly contagious delta variant.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

BERLIN— New COVID-19 infections in Germany have reached their highest level in nearly three months amid a steady rise powered by the delta variant.

The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said Saturday that 51.6 new cases per 100,000 residents were reported over the last seven days. It’s the first time since May 25 that the infection rate has been above 50, but it has been increasing since hitting a low of 4.9 in early July.

The disease control center said that 8,092 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours -- up from 5,644 a week earlier. More cases are getting detected as summer vacations end and children return to schools in some parts of Germany.

German authorities have been trying to reinvigorate the country’s COVID-19 vaccination drive, which has slowed considerably. Official figures showed that 63.8% of Germany’s population had received at least one vaccine dose as of Thursday and 58.5% was fully vaccinated.

HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam’s government says it is sending troops to Ho Chi Minh City to help deliver food and aid to households as it further tightens restrictions on people’s movements amid a worsening surge of the coronavirus.

The army personnel will be deployed to help with logistics as the city of 10 million people asks residents to “stay put” for two weeks starting from Monday, a report on the government website said Friday.

The move comes as Vietnam, which weathered much the pandemic with very few cases, recorded more than 10,000 new infections and 390 deaths on Friday. Ho Chi Minh City accounted for 3,500 of those infections.

Ho Chi Minh City has had strict coronavirus measures in place since June, including banning gatherings of more than two people in public and only allowing people to leave home for essential matters like buying food or going to work in certain permitted businesses. Under the new measures, people in high risk areas cannot leave home at all.

HONOLULU — A hospital serving a Honolulu suburb on Friday has filled up as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases.

All 104 beds at The Queen’s Medical Center - West Oahu are full, said Jason Chang, the CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems.

The Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It’s also asked staff from other parts of the Queen’s system to come help.

The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital that has 25 cots. The hospital may also add beds in hallways and other makeshift areas but not all patients will get rooms.

Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds. Twenty-six of those in the ER were there with possible COVID-19 infections.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A federal team of health care workers has been deployed to a coastal Alabama hospital that is being ‘crushed’ with a surge of COVID-19 patients, the state health officer said Friday.

State Health Officer Scott Harris said the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is sending a task force team, that includes nurses, a doctor and others, to help at South Baldwin Regional Medical Center in Foley. Similar help had been sent to help in Louisiana and Mississippi.

Coastal areas have been particularly hard hit by the recent COVID-19 surge, and the team was sent to the area having the greatest need, state health officials said.

Alabama is seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases that medical officials say is being fueled by low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.

MIAMI — Florida officials are threatening to withhold funds equal to the salaries of school board members if school districts in two counties don’t immediately do away with strict mask mandates as the state continues to battle through high hospitalization rates.

School boards in Broward and Alachua counties received a warning Friday from the State Board of Education giving them 48 hours to walk back their decisions to require masks for all students, only exempting those with a doctor’s note.

“We cannot have government officials pick and choose what laws they want to follow,” Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran said in an emailed statement. “These are the initial consequences to their intentional refusal to follow state law and state rule to purposefully and willingly violate the rights of parents.”

Corcoran said the two districts are violating the Parents’ Bill of Rights and a late July executive order by Gov. Ron DeSantis that prompted rules limiting how far districts can go with mask requirements. DeSantis maintains masks can be detrimental for children’s development.

But board members in the two countries decided not to allow parents to easily opt out of the mandate as surging cases fueled by the delta variant strained hospitals.

FRANKFORT, Ky. — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s campaign for COVID-19 vaccinations gained a new voice with a highly personal testimonial — a one-time vaccine skeptic recounting his debilitating fight against the virus.

Ethan Koehler, 28, spoke in stark terms of his journey from downplaying the pandemic to being laid low by excruciating pain, struggles to breathe and then “relearning” to walk without losing his breath as the coronavirus ravaged his health.

“I was very, very big on anti-COVID, anti-vaccine,” Koehler said. “I made Facebook posts, public posts, talked to people, made a big deal about it. Made a point to not wear a mask. Made a point to say that COVID wasn’t important. And I am eating crow on it, because I experienced it.”

Koehler’s video message was shown at Beshear’s media briefing Thursday afternoon. After months of imploring Kentuckians to take COVID-19 shots, the governor has turned increasingly to others to help make the case.

Koehler’s ordeal highlighted another alarming trend — growing infection rates among younger Kentuckians, who are less likely to be vaccinated.

SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco has become the first major city in the United States to require proof of full vaccination against the coronavirus for people to dine inside restaurants, work out in gyms or attend indoor concerts.

Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff Friday to begin verifying people’s proof of vaccination before allowing them in.

The new rule goes beyond New York City, which only requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of indoor activities.

Local business groups in San Francisco have supported the new vaccine mandate, saying it will protect their employees’ and customers’ health and keep them from having to limit capacity indoors.

RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law on Friday.

The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers.

The measure received near unanimous support in the state's Republican-controlled legislature.

“This important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,” Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing.

Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use. The coronavirus vaccine produced by Pfizer is the only COVID-19 vaccine now available in the U.S. for children 12 and older.

North Carolina has given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues. That previously included obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine if they showed “the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly is calling for school districts to require masks and says she is considering declaring an emergency as hospitals strain to handle increasingly young COVID-19 patients.

Kelly said that “we really want people to understand that this is no fooling around.”

The latest health department data shows 154 coronavirus clusters in schools, with a total of 1,889 cases.

Kelly noted that schools in other states have shut down completely over outbreaks. She says that until a coronavirus vaccine is approved for children under age 12, using masks can help curb the spread of infections.

The governor said more COVID-19 patients were admitted to Kansas hospitals Wednesday than any other single day during the pandemic and ICUs are at 100% capacity at six of the state’s largest hospitals, with two-thirds of the beds going to COVID-19 patients.

BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is calling on parents to take seriously the coronavirus risks for children and to ensure students wear face masks.

Schools that resumed classes this month already have reported more than 5,300 students and 750 employees who have tested positive for the virus. Those numbers are expected to grow larger.

Edwards has enacted a statewide mask mandate that includes schools. That has prompted angry outcries from some parents who argue they should decide whether to put a mask on their children.

The governor said Friday: “Transmission is very high. Simply put, we cannot keep our schools open or our kids safe today without masks.”The S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week on concerns the Federal Reserve may be dialing back its monthly stimulus spending sooner than expected.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released its meeting minutes from its July meeting, which suggested the Fed may begin tapering its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases before the end of 2021. However, committee members said the economy still needs to make “substantial further progress” in employment before the Fed will consider raising interest rates.

Investors are also growing increasingly concerned that the spread of the delta variant of COVID-19 will derail or delay the global economic reopening. Stocks in the energy, materials, industrials and travel and leisure sectors, which are all highly sensitive to the economic reopening, traded lower on the week.

On Friday, China continued its aggressive crackdown on domestic tech companies by approving a major new data protection law that will restrict the ways Chinese companies can collect and store user data starting on Nov. 1. Shares of Chinese tech stocks Alibaba, Pinduoduo and JD.Com have all traded sharply lower in response to the crackdown.

COVID-19 vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson announced on Friday that vice chairman Joaquin Duato will take over for current CEO Alex Gorsky on Jan. 3, 2022. Johnson & Johnson navigated a string of negative headlines during Gorsky’s nine years as CEO, including lawsuits linking the company’s talc-based baby powder to cancer and a $26 billion settlement related to the company’s role in the deadly opioid epidemic.

Robinhood’s stock dropped more than 13% last week after the company released its first quarterly earnings report and warned investors that trading activity is slowing down.

This week, investors will be watching earnings reports from JD.Com on Monday, Pinduoduo on Tuesday, and Salesforce and Snowflake on Wednesday.

Roughly 87% of S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter revenue exceeding analyst expectations so far in the second quarter, the highest percentage of revenue beats since at least 2008, according to FactSet.

Following the Federal Reserve’s recent taping commentary, Wall Street will get more economic updates on Thursday when the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases its preliminary second-quarter U.S. GDP growth estimate and on Friday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers a speech at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium.

Benzinga is a financial news and data company headquartered in Detroit.Permanent Secretary for Fisheries, Pene Baleinabuli says this is for those who want to upgrade their vessels or build new ones.

Baleinabuli says the initiative is targeted towards making our tuna industry more competitive.

He adds the majority of Fijian flagged vessels have aged and don’t have the capacity needed to operate.

“There’s a conscience to help build energy-efficient vessels. Those vessels are expected to have larger storage carrying capacity. So it just means our industry will be able to go and compete where the real money for tuna is.”

The PS says the assistance from the government will help improve Fiji’s Tuna pathway to international markets.A view of Fincantieri shipyard is seen in Monfalcone near Trieste, in northest Italy, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo

MILAN, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri (FCT.MI) is talking to Leonardo (LDOF.MI) about a possible acquisition of the defence group's OTO Melara unit, a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday.

There are contacts between the two groups over the unit, the source said.

Italian daily La Stampa on Saturday reported that Fincantieri was in early talks to buy OTO Melara, famous for its naval gun production, and could launch an offer before the end of the year.

The newspaper said any deal would be vetted by the Italian Treasury which is top shareholder in Leonardo and, through state lender CDP, Fincantieri.A Brookhaven telecommunications veteran has been named president and chief executive officer of Unitek Global Services Inc.

Charlie Smith, president of SDT Solutions LLC in Brookhaven, was named CEO and president Wednesday of SDT’s parent company Unitek.

“Charlie has lived in Brookhaven all his life, coming from very humble beginnings,” said SDT Senior Vice President James Ezell Jr. “He and I have worked together 40-plus years. He has been a great mentor, friend, business partner and life coach.”

Smith has held leadership positions in the telecommunications infrastructure services industry for more than 35 years and has extensive knowledge of all aspects of telecommunications engineering and construction. A founding investor of SDT, he has served as CEO since 1999 and continued in the position after Unitek purchased the company in 2018. Smith led the company’s evolution into a leading telecom engineering and instruction company focused on the southeastern and south-central regions of the United States.

Andrew Crouch, Unitek’s current president and CEO, will remain as an advisor to Smith and the board to support a smooth leadership transition.

“We would like to thank Andrew for his contributions to Unitek [and] leadership,” Unitek Board of Directors member John Kline said. “We are excited about Unitek’s future with Charlie [Smith] at the helm and look forward to supporting the company as it continues to provide solutions to improve the nation’s communications infrastructure, including in rural areas where those enhancements are most needed.”

Unitek is headquartered in Irving, Texas, and in addition to Brookhaven has offices in Kentucky, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Canada, and operations in more than 80 locations across North America.
